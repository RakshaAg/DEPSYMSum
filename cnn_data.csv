Authorities say 75-year-old John Goodwin, of Atkinson, went on trial this week on six counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault. Prosecutors said that Atkinson, who pleaded not guilty, repeatedly sexually assaulted a student, who is now 24 years old, according to SeaCoastOnline. John Goodwin, 75, shot himself outside of Rockingham County Superior Courthouse on Friday morning while jurors were deliberating claims that Goodwin had sexually assaulted an underage student .

The former Liverpool forward made the claim before Brendan Rodgers' men lost 4-1 at the Emirates on Saturday - a game in which Ozil netted his side's second goal. Owen's opinion drew criticism on social media but the ex-England man has refused to back down, even after Sterling's disappointing display in north London. Raheem Sterling, pictured against Arsenal, is a better player than Mesut Ozil according to Michael Owen . Ozil bends home Arsenal's second goal in their 4-1 win against Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday . BT Sport pundit Owen believes there should not be a debate about whether Sterling is more talented than Ozil . Asked whether Sterling could fit into Arsene Wenger's team before Saturday's game, Owen told BT Sport: 'I would think so, they would find some way. 'He's better than Ozil, I think he's probably better than [Danny] Welbeck.' But even after watching Ozil shine and Sterling struggle in Arsenal's win against his former club, Owen repeated his claim that the wantaway forward is a superior player. Owen wrote on his Sportlobster account: 'It seems my claim that Sterling is a better player than Ozil made some headlines today. Is there a debate? Not even close.'

The Minnesota Vikings running back played once last season before being placed on the Commissioner's Exempt list due to a child abuse case. The 30-year-old was was due to be reinstated on April 15, but according to NFL media insider Ian Rapoport, Peterson will meet with the NFL this week. Peterson's situation is far from clear, with the 2012 MVP telling ESPN he was 'uneasy' about returning to the franchise. Adrian Peterson has plenty to chew over but the Minnesota Vikings do not want to trade their star back . It has been a turbulent seven months for Peterson, who has been linked with the Cowboys and Cardinals . His main bone of contention  is said to be with chief operating officer Kevin Warren, whom the Peterson camp claims attempted to keep him off the field last year. The Vikings start offseason workouts in a fortnight and head coach Mike Zimmer has repeatedly spoken of his desire for Peterson to stay. 'I'm not going to speculate on what he wants or doesn't want,' Zimmer said last month. 'Adrian's under contract for three more years with us, and that's why you sign those contracts. That's why you get these big bonuses, you know?' 'We have no plans to trade Adrian,' he said, definitively. Peterson is under contract for 2015, and is set to earn a base salary of $12.75million from the Vikings. The Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals are repeatedly linked as potential landing spots and when his status is settled, it will be one step nearer to finding out where his future lies."
16f5d36bac3f9d50a08d6b0626ee0dce80921567,"Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped. Most of the compensation consisted of stock valued at $100 million. It was the largest stock package that Schmidt has received since 2011 when Google Inc. awarded him a bundle valued at $94 million at the time he relinquished the CEO's job to company co-founder Larry Page. Documents filed with regulators Thursday also disclosed that Page and the company's other founder, Sergey Brin, limited their 2014 pay to $1 each, as has been their practice for years. Payday: Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped, it's been revealed . Schmidt also pocketed a $1.25 million salary, a $6 million bonus and perks valued at nearly $1 million. His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million. The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects. Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content. The downturn in Google's stock contrasted with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year. Schmidt, 59, already is among the world's richest people with an estimated fortune of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001. The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. It does not include changes in the present value of pension benefits, so the AP total can differ slightly from the total reported by company.

f255229f40fcf945ddb75440003ac944bf6a51aa,"It seems that 2014 was a very, very good year to be Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from Friday, it was revealed that Zaslav was compensated an unbelievable $156.1million last year. This amount, thanks to the success of television events like Shark Week, shows like the once popular Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and his running of networks like OWN, makes him one of the highest paid television executives. Scroll down for video . David Zaslav (above) was compensated $156.1million for his role as CEO of Discovery Communications it was revealed on Friday . This thanks to shows like the once popular Here Comes Honey Boo Boo (left) and his running of networks like Oprah Winfrey's OWN (right) Discovery has also done well thanks to the success of television events like Shark Week . Variety reports that a large portion of that money comes from stocks, with Zaslav receiving $144million in awards for his six-year contract. 1.Sumner Redstone (CBS, Viacom) - $93.4m . 2.Les Moonves (CBS) - $66.9m . 3.Philippe Dauman (Viacom) - $37.2m . 4.Bob Iger (Disney) - $34.3m . 5.David Zaslav (Discovery) - $33.3m . 6.Jeffrey Bewkes (Time Warner) - $32.5m . 7.Brian Roberts (Comcast) - $31.4m . 8.Stephen Burke (NBC) - $31.1m . 9.Chris Albrecht (Starz) - $30.5m . 10.Thomas Dooley (Viacom) - $29.1m . It is a remarkable boost from the $33million he received in 2013, with $22.5million of that also coming from stock awards. The amount seems to be deserved as well, as under Zaslav's guidance, the company's market cap has grown from $5billion in 2007 to $20billion today. As for his base salary, that was $3million, where it will stay for the length of his contract, and he can no receive a cash bonus greater than $6.6million until the last two years of his new contract, when that amount goes to $9million. This amount is far, far greater than the two television executives who made the most last year, Sumer Redstone and Les Moonves. Redstone, who heads up CBS and Viacomn, took home $93.4million, while Moonves, the CEO of CBS, took home $66.9million. 'This contract rewards Mr. Zaslav for the value he has created and the continued strategic direction he provides and requires sustained performance over time for that award to have value,' the filing states. 'At the end of his contract, Mr. Zaslav will own a substantial amount of equity of Discovery, which reinforces his alignment with our shareholders and encourages long-term ownership of our stock.' This amount is far, far greater than the $93million CBS chairman Sumner Redstone (left) made in 2013 and the $67m Les Moonves (right) made . Zaslav is also likely to become the biggest shareholder at Discovery under this new contract is he buys the shares of television mogul John Malone who also holds a sizable stake in the company. He will have right of first refusal to purchase Malone's stocks should he sell. The contract will expire in 2019."

While at the scene an unidentified gunman shot Brown and a 15 year old dead . Milwaukee police say the driver of a van who struck and killed a 2-year-old has been shot dead at the scene of the accident - possibly in revenge. A 15-year-old boy was also shot and later died - though it's not clear what his connection to the incident was. Police Captain Timothy Heier says the car accident occurred at 5:10pm Sunday after the child ran into the street in a residential neighborhood on the 4600 block of North 48th Street in Milwaukee. The driver remained at the scene and stayed in his van while police arrived. Before officers could show up, someone opened fire - shooting the driver in the head. He died at the scene. A 15-year-old boy was also shot and later died at the hospital. Police say the teen was not a passenger in the van. The driver's father identified him as father-of-four Archie Brown Jr, to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Police are still looking for the person responsible, and so far they have released few details on the tragic incident. Milwaukee Alberman Joe Davis was called to the scene on Sunday and gave statements, indicating the shooting may have been carried out in revenge for the little child's death. Scroll down for video .

However a local alderman suggested that the shooting was carried out in revenge of the child's death . 'I know that the people in that house may have been very, very upset about the incident — the vehicular incident that occurred, but you don’t solve these types of things with guns, and start shooting and taking other people’s lives,' Davis said. Archie Brown Sr told the Journal Sentinel that police showed him a picture of the victim, who he identified as his son, and learned that he had been shot in the head. Archie Brown Sr. identified his son, father-of-four Archie Brown Jr., as the driver who was shot in the head and killed at the scene .

Brown's half brother Riles Rilley also spoke with the Journal Sentinel and said that Brown was the co-owner of Seven West nightclub. 'Just a good person all around. Never had any enemies. Always looking to do the right thing,' he said."

But that was Prince Harry’s only nod to formality yesterday as he began his month-long visit Down Under. Indeed, the playful royal larked around like a true larrikin. He laughed and joked with wellwishers. He offered handshakes and high fives. And he gurned like a good-un, making himself an instant hit with younger fans. Prince Harry was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, all keen to catch a glimpse of the royal . The Prince pulled funny faces at a young girl waiting in the crowd with her mother, as others snapped photos on their smartphones . 'The people's Prince' continued to show off his playful side, high-fiving a young boy who was waiting behind a barricade . The Prince is in Australia to report for official military duty but he enjoyed his interaction with excited fans . Prince Harry has declared 'selfies are bad' during his visit to the Australian capital of Canberra as revellers scrambled to get a piece of the royal on their camera phones . The prince spent 20 minutes chatting and posing for photographs for crowds in Canberra, where he made a beeline for a youngster with a banner saying ‘Redheads Rule’. Ginger-haired Ethan Toscan, 12, who earned a high five from the royal after he spotted his home-made sign in the crowd, said: ‘He said it was awesome to be a redhead. 'It was a pleasure meeting the prince and being able to shake his hand and give him a high five. I’m over the moon.’ While Harry was clearly eager to please, he didn’t go as far as agreeing to a selfie with a teenage admirer. The prince, 30, smiled as he told the girl: ‘No, I hate selfies ... I know you’re young, but selfies are bad. Just take a normal photograph.’ This seems to be a view shared by his grandmother, the Queen, who has said she finds it ‘strange’ to be greeted by a sea of smartphones at public engagements. Harry joked around with Ethan after spotting his sign and walking over to chat with the 12-year-old boy . Young Prince Harry fan Ethan poses with his 'Red Heads Rule' poster outside Canberra's War Memorial on Monday . Hundreds waited in the rain to see Harry, who was wearing a wristband in support of his charity project the Invictus Games – a sports event for injured service personnel – featuring the slogan: ‘I am the master of my fate.’ On arrival at the Australian War Memorial, he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is likely to be his only public engagement during a four-week attachment to the Australian army, during which he is expected to train on helicopter simulators and join bush patrols in the North. Harry is in the last few weeks of his service before leaving the Army in June. He and Prince Charles will travel to Turkey later this month for the Anzac Day dawn service at Gallipoli, where Commonwealth forces including a joint Australian and New Zealand army suffered heavy casualties during the First World War. There was a potentially awkward moment as Dr Brendan Nelson, director of the Australian War Memorial, asked if Harry had seen the film ‘Gallipoli’. The 1981 movie, starring Mel Gibson, was criticised by some historians for depicting the British as ordering waves of Australian soldiers to their deaths. Harry said he had not seen the film and was told: ‘It’s worth watching.’ One woman grabbed Harry's face and leaned in for a kiss on the cheek, with the Prince happily obliging . Prince Harry put a smile on the faces of young and the old as the enthusiastic Aussies waited to greet him in the pouring Canberra rain .

Brayden Travis, 18, was left without medical attention for seven hours after taking drugs at a friend's house in St Charles County, Missouri in early March. His lungs and kidneys failed, and he suffered a stroke and severe brain damage. Doctors warned that he will likely remain in a vegetative state, his mother, Kelly Smith-Miller, wrote on Facebook. She also shared a starling photograph of the teenager unconscious in a hospital bed with breathing apparatus and wires across his body. Overdose: Brayden Travis, 18, suffered a stroke and severe brain damage after overdosing on heroin and Xanax last month. His mother shared this photo of him to Facebook to deter others from taking drugs . 'If my son's story and picture can save one life or contribute to the education and awareness of drug abuse, then he and I are very happy!' she wrote in her post. 'He wouldn't want this for anyone else and he would tell anyone not to use drugs … ever! I can tell you he tried to fight this addiction and I pray this time it hasn't won!' The post has been shared more than 337,000 times. Brayden is now breathing on his own and wakes up and opens and closes his eyes, although his reactions are inconsistent, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. 'Medical personnel believe my son should have been dead long before he was able to get the medical attention he needed, but for some unknown reason he has stabilized,' she wrote. Addiction: His mother explained that Brayden, left before the overdose, has struggled with drug addiction since he was 15. He is now conscious in hospital, seen right, and is breathing on his own . 'He is making progress, but we have a long road to travel. Even though the outcome is not expected to be positive, as a mother I will not give up until I have exhausted all options and know that I've done everything I can.' Brayden had long been battling with addiction, she said. He first started smoking marijuana when he was 15 and eventually moved on to heroin. He enrolled in five or six treatment programs and left three of them, she told the Post-Dispatch. He spent eight months in juvenile custody for using drugs and failing drug tests, she added. As he struggled with addiction, he moved between his grandmother's home and his mother's home, and at the time of his overdose, he was living with his father in St Charles County. By his side: Mother Kelly Smith-Miller, pictured with her son left, and his father, Todd Travis, right, said they hope he will pull though so he can 'come home and have a life that will be worth living' 'He was living with me doing well, then I go in his room every morning to check on him and he is gone,' his dad, Todd Travis, wrote on his own Facebook page. 'He is my only child, my mini me, and my life! Please everyone pray for Brayden to someday have his body and and his brain healed so he can come home and have a life that will be worth living.' Speaking to the Post-Dispatch, Travis, who tried to set a good example for his son by working out and eating well, added: 'You go over what you could have done better.' But he is still hopeful that his son will recover, and shared his joy on Facebook that his son has been laughing in hospital. 'I'm looking into his eyes, man - and he's looking at me,' he said."

She faces six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Visitors heard a scream at 3pm on Saturday and looked to see Schwab, 38, and her husband leaping into the pit to retrieve the child, who was treated for a leg injury. On Monday, a spokesman for KinderCare, a nationally-acclaimed education, care and resource provider, confirmed Schwab has taken a leave of absence from her management role at one of the centers in Columbus, Ohio.

She is an assistant director at KinderCare . Witnesses say Schwab jumped in to retrieve the boy from the compound at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo at 3pm on Saturday. The animals appeared to ignore the boy, witnesses say (file image of one of the zoo's cheetahs) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . In an email to DailyMail.com, spokesman Colleen Moran said: 'We were saddened to hear of Saturday’s incident at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo involving Michelle Schwab’s son, and we wish him a speedy recovery. 'Ms Schwab has been the Assistant Director at the Sawmill Road KinderCare in Columbus. She is currently home with her family, and will remain out of our center while this issue is investigated and addressed. 'In addition to the agencies looking into this issue, we are looking into the incident further ourselves, as we closely examine issues involving the treatment of children by our employees, even if those incidents arise outside of our centers.' Schwab, of Delaware, Ohio, was charged on Monday in Cleveland Municipal Court and will be arraigned on April 22. On Sunday, Dr Christopher Kuhar, executive director at the zoo, said the two felines did not approach the boy when he fell in the pit. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' The exhibit was closed following the child's fall. Zoo visitor Michael Lurie was at the cheetah exhibit when he heard the child scream.

c63e7e57773fae20ca99d77cc72213ae423c026c,"A Romanian woman being deported from New Zealand after leaving her partner, has been told she must leave her two-year-old son behind. 34-year-old Nicole Mihai was told by the immigration agency that she will now have to return to Romania as she is not a New Zealand resident. However, the Family Court have ruled that her young son, Chris, is not able to reside further than 50 kilometres from his New Zealand father. She now faces a distressing battle with the immigration agency who insist Chris's future living arrangements 'are not their problem.' A Romanian woman being deported from New Zealand after relationship broke down, has been told she must leave her 2-year-old son, Chris behind . Nicole Mihai was told by New Zealand Immigration that once her Visa expires, she must return to Romania . 'I go to sleep at night and and wake up in the morning and think today may be the last day with my son,' Ms. Mihai told Daily Mail Australia. 'I go to sleep at night and and wake up in the morning and think today may be the last day with my son,' Ms Mihai said . Ms. Mihai separated from her New Zealand born partner after a two-year relationship. She was awarded full custody of their son, with her ex partner having little contact with Chris. Once they separated, immigration had Ms Mihai's Visa cancelled. 'I had to apply for a temporary Visa and residency,' she said. 'That was almost a year ago, and I've been fighting with them ever since.' According to Ms Mihai, the Immigration Agency have informed her that her application has nothing to do with Chris and therefore he is none of their concern. 'Immigration doesn't take all of the facts into consideration,' she said. In order for Chris to move to Romania to be with his mother, his father would need to sign a contract allowing him to go, which Ms Mihai strongly doubts. 'Even if he signed and Chris were to come with me, we would have to live in a two bedroom home with my mother, my sister and her child,' she said. 'It would be very hard for me to get a job and my mother cannot support all of us.' Ms Mihai moved to New Zealand seven years ago and worked as a waitress on minimum wage. She admits that she does struggle just like all other single mothers, but she has a new job as a branch manager and her and her son are happy in New Zealand. 'My son was born here... He doesn't know anything else,' Ms Mihai said. A ruling from the Family Court said Ms Mihai's son Chris must remain within 50 kilometres of his Kiwi father . The 34-year-old vows to fight this battle until the end and will not give up her life with her son . 'From Monday to Friday, eight til six, he's in daycare with his friends and for me to take him to a strange place where he doesn't know anybody would be very difficult for him.' Ms Mihai does not know when the end point to this battle will be, but she has had her temporary Visa extended until June 26 which is when she is expecting to receive a final decision. However she said she will fight this battle until the end and will not give up her life with Chris. 'I'd rather die than live one day without my son,' she said. 'I'm just hoping that everything will get sorted and I can just move on with my life and my son's life.'"
4a7e57cce1d381dc9ad7d2c6744863ced4cfcc0b,"Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton issued a pointed defense of her family foundation on Thursday after allegations surfaced that it reaped millions from foreign countries that had issues pending before her mother when she was secretary of state. 'What the Clinton Foundation has said is that we will be even more transparent' in the wake of the scandalous claims, said Chelsea, the philanthropy's vice chair, 'even though Transparency International and others have said we're among the most transparent of foundations.' Clinton, the daughter of former U.S. president Bill Clinton and presumptive Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, spoke during an event on women and girls at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Chelsea Clinton defended her family philanthropy on Thursday in New York, calling it 'among the most transparent of foundations' The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is under fire for allegedly accepting millions from foreign entities in exchange for special favors from the State Department when Hillary Clinton was at its helm . Hillary Clinton (seen Wednesday at Georgetown University) was helping approve Russia's purchase of US uranium production as her foundation received millions from executives tied to the deal . ABC News hosted the event, and reported that Chelsea outlined what she said is 'the right policy. That we'll be even more transparent. That to eliminate any questions while we're in this time, we won't take new government funding, but that the work will continue as it is.' The foundation recently committed to stop taking donations from foreign governments but insisted it wouldn't return money it has already collected. That hasn't sat well with Republicans vying for their party's presidential nomination: Hillary Clinton is Public Enemy Number One on the campaign trail, and they smell blood. 'Having raised tens of millions of dollars from foreign nations presents a clear conflict of interest for anyone running for President of the United States,' Texas Sen. Ted Cruz wrote Wednesday on Facebook . Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who hasn't formally entered the 2016 hunt, told Daily Mail Online that 'not only should they definitely give back the money and cease accepting foreign donations, but should also make every effort to find missing documents that would shed light if in fact they are innocent.' More problems: The Clinton Foundation erroneously reported it had received no funds from governments for three years – even though it previously received millions – and now has to refile its tax returns . Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly FIorina called the series of accusations against Bill and Hillary 'the Clinton way: raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep.' The Republican National Committee pounced as well. 'The new revelations reported by the New York Times continue to raise serious questions about Hillary Clinton's judgment and her handling of conflicts of interest surrounding the Clinton Foundation while serving as Secretary of State,' RNC spokeswoman Allison Moore said in a statement. Thursday's unrelenting news cycle about possible overlaps between the former first family's personal and charitable finances were prompted by details emerging about a new book titled 'Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.' The book, due in stores next month, reportedly includes evidence that Hillary Clinton doled out special State Department favors to governments – and for-profit companies tied to them – in exchange for foundation donations and six-figure speaking fes for Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon laid out a lengthy defense on Thursday, writing online that a New York Times article outlining the charges included no 'direct evidence in support of the claim' that Mrs. Clinton did anything wrong. Former president Bill Clinton (left) received $500,000 for a Moscow speaking engagement with Renaissance Capital. He also met Vladimir Putin (right), at the time Russia's prime minister, during the visit . This week in New Hampshire, Hillary herself brushed off the brewing scandal. 'We're back into the political scene, and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and I'm ready for it,' she told reporters in the town of Keene. 'I know that comes unfortunately with the territory.' 'It is, I think, worth noting that the Republicans seem to be talking only about me,' she added. 'They wouldn't have anything to talk about if I weren't in the race. But I am in the race, and hopefully we'll get onto the issues, and I look forward to that.' Mrs. Clinton herself has yet to outline any serious public policy positions in connection with her run for the White House."
1c57fc0a5edfe8a0e66770d6e736b571f5ab500e,"A former doctor charged with killing a Yale University physician he once worked with has been found incompetent to stand trial for the second time. New Haven Superior Court Judge Thomas O'Keefe Jr. ruled Monday that 49-year-old Lishan Wang should be sent to Connecticut Valley Hospital for treatment. In a court report submitted last month, mental health experts said Wang displayed 'paranoid thinking' and was 'guarded and suspicious' when discussing a relationship with court-appointed lawyers. Lishan Wang was charged with murder in the shooting of Yale University doctor Vajinder Toor outside his home in April 2010 . He was originally ruled incompetent in 2010, but he was restored to competency after being treated at Connecticut Valley Hospital. A new evaluation was ruled after a public defender filed a motion asking for the court to terminate Wang's self-representation . The ruling came after two mental health experts testified that Wang is unable to rationally understand criminal proceedings or assist in his defense, according to The Hartford Courant. Wang, a father of three, is charged with murder in the shooting of Dr. Vajinder Toor, 34, and shooting but missing Toor's then-pregnant wife outside the couple's Branford, Connecticut, home in April 2010. Police say the shooting stemmed from a dispute the men had two years earlier while working together at a New York City hospital. Wang, who represented himself at the hearing, is due back in court on May 21. The report said that Wang would not be able to 'establish an effective relationship with a defense attorney or to organize himself in a manner that he could be meaningfully understood by others' in his current state. Wang and Toor worked together at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in New York City, and Wang had a history of confronting Toor and other staff members before his dismissal in 2008. Toor (pictured) was shot outside of his Branford, Connecticut, home. After the shooting, Wang was found in his van with documents referring to his dismissal from Kingsbrook Medical Center in New York City, where it's believed he had confrontations with Toor . After the shooting, police found Wang in his van with documents referring to his dismissal and others involved. They also found a wig, hammer, knife and about a thousand rounds of ammunition. In 2010 Wang was originally ruled incompetent, but he was restored to competency after being treated at Connecticut Valley Hospital. When a second competency evaluation was ordered earlier this year after Chief Public Defender Thomas J. Ullmann filed a motion asking for the court to terminate Wang's self-representation. Ullmann said that Wang is mentally ill, which Wang countered by accusing the public defenders of working against him. 'This is much more complicated because of particular issues in this case that it's hard for me to figure out even where to start,' O'Keefe told The Hartford Courant. 'He chooses to represent himself, which he has a right to do, but it causes some problems on how to proceed.' Wang has asked to represent himself in his trial and accused the public defender's office of working against him . While representing himself, Wang will have an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses, make his own statements and testify on his own behalf. Though Wang did not testify at Monday's hearing, he referred to a rebuttal of the competency report in which he quoted Dostoyevsky, Socrates, Richard Nixon, Abraham Lincoln and alleged Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, as well as recounts two parables. Wang said that the experts misinterpreted his answers, misquoted him and lacked knowledge about his 'cultural background'. One of the experts from the competency report, Madelon Baranoski, said that Wang lost his 'path of rational thinking' during the evaluation and that he suffers from 'a very serious mental illness'. She added that his distrust of the public defender's office was 'reaching psychotic proportions'. 'It is our opinion that you need treatment,' she said. Police investigate the murder scene of Yale University doctor Vajinder Toor in Branford, Connecticut, Monday, April 26, 2010 ."
93c1f2e19b66d2c7409aeb7aeb1b03e1f9f3c241,"A federal judge has ordered the Internal Revenue Service to hand over a list of the 298 tea party organizations that it targeted with broad and often intrusive questions when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status. The decision from U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott means right-wing groups are a step closer to being allowed to pursue a class-action lawsuit against the IRS. The agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010, when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red-flag words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names. While those organizations' applications were held up for years, liberal groups sailed through the process. Federal tax-exempt status is confered on groups that serve a public purpose, including issue advocacy, and allows them to promise tax deductions to their donors. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . F.U.I.R.S.: American conservatives were up in marks in 2013 after the IRS confirmed it had been slow-walking tax-exemption applications from tea party groups based on red-flag words in their names . Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the heart of the tea party targeting scandal, ran the 'Exempt Organizations' division until late 2013 when she retired with full benefits; the Justice Department said this week that it won't prosecute her for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions . Tax-exempt organizations are not permitted to work for or against candidates for public office, but they can use up to half of their funds to make public arguments about political matters like tax policy, the Obamacare insurance overhaul, the environment or foreign policy. Dlott agreed this week that the tea party groups suing the government can pursue their claims that the IRS violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights, along with a section of federal law – Section 6103 of Title 26 – that prohibits the government from releasing private information contained in tax returns. When the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General investigated the IRS's actions, it demanded – and received – a list of 298 groups whose tax-exemption applications had been held up. It's this list that the tea party groups want. Their lawsuit aims first to identify a list of 'all dissenting groups targeted for additional scrutiny by the IRS from January 20, 2009, through July 15, 2013.' Dlott could then choose to certify that list as a 'class' of plaintiffs. IRS commissioner John Koskinen has insisted that his agency is no longer targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny, and has offered to green-list any group that promises it will limit its political activity to 40 per cent of its budget – but some organizations are holdout out, claiming the law entitles them to a 50 per cent limit . The IRS's lawyers claimed that they couldn't provide the court with the names of all the groups, saying they would have to turn over the very documents that Section 6103 requires them to keep confidential. The conservative plaintiffs said they would be happy to have only the spreadsheet that the inspector general got from the IRS. Dlott agreed and ordered the agency to hand it over. 'The Court concludes that the return information sought is directly related to the issue of class certification in this federal court proceeding,' her ruling reads. 'The names of the putative class member organizations and their control dates – the date which the putative class member organizations submitted their applications for tax exempt status to the IRS – are directly related to the issue of class certification.' Dlott decided that without the list, the plaintiffs wouldn't be able to show all the disaffected conservative applicants it has already identified share common experiences at the hands of America's tax collectors. Courthouse News Service first reported her ruling. The IRS is the federal agency Americans most love to hate, polling worse in opinion surveys than Congress . A partial list was unearthed by USA Today in September 2013, showing that as of 2011 the IRS had questioned the political advocacy of 162 right-wing organizations and delayed approving their tax exemptions. In an IRS spreadsheet published online by the newspaper, partisan government officials characterized the activities of 21 of those groups as 'propaganda.' Dlott also ordered the IRS to tell the court whether or not that list was authentic, The Washington Times reported. Former IRS official Lois Lerner, who has been at the center of the targeting scandal since it emerged in 23 months ago, was facing the possibility of criminal Contempt of Congress charges until the Obama administration's Department of Justice declined on Monday to prosecute her. Lerner, under subpoena in May 2013, delivered an opening statement professing her innocence during a hearing but then refused to answer questions."
f48a1745c08f3a784a73c9f7b113bf705a2c603f,"A woman in her 70s may be forced to sell her childhood home to fund her elderly mother’s care after losing a landmark court case that could have implications for families across Britain. Theatre director Glen Walford has been told by judges that the house, where she has recently invested £40,000 in renovations, was not her home at the time when her mother went into care because she rents a flat in London. Miss Walford, 75, has spent two years fighting Worcestershire County Council over whether the £205,000 house should be used to recover the cost of her mother’s care. Glen Walford (left) has been embroiled in a legal battle with Worcestershire County Council since her mother Mary (right) moved to a care home in 2006. The theatre director intended to retire to the property . Now the council has won the right to force Miss Walford to use the equity in the house, where she intended to retire, for care home fees, which can be up to £600 a week. Solicitors warned that the case could pave the way for relatives across the country to be liable for their parents’ care. Charlotte Kelly, an associate at Worcestershire legal firm Kerwoods, said: ‘This was a very significant judgment and one which will affect many in similar situations.’ When her mother Mary Walford, now aged 100, was admitted into care in 2006, the council agreed that the house in Stourport-on-Severn should not be taken into account during means testing. But in 2013 they reversed their decision and said that Miss Walford would need to begin contributing towards bills. Frustrated by the U-turn, Miss Walford became embroiled in a legal battle with the council which was taken to the High Court in January 2014. Miss Walford said she had always planned to retire to her mother's house in Stourpour-upon-Severn (above) There, a judge ruled that her home should not be taken into account when means testing was carried out on her mother’s finances. In his ruling, Justice Supperstone concluded: ‘A “home” is a place to which a person has a degree of attachment both physical and emotional.’ But the council took the case to the Court of Appeal, arguing that although the property may be her home, it was not at the time her mother was taken into care. Yesterday Miss Walford said: ‘I am now in a position where I will almost certainly have to sell my home to pay for my mother’s care bills which will leave me homeless. I have no energy or money left to fight them.’ Sunnydene has been in the family for decades and was built by her grandmother’s aunt in the mid-1800s. Miss Walford’s car is parked in the drive, her belongings fill the bedrooms and she has an office where she carries out her work. Yet she is often posted across the globe and, when working on national productions, needs to be based in London. As a result Miss Walford rents a bedsit owned by a friend in the centre of the capital. Miss Walford, who has never married and has no children, said: ‘Sunnydene is my home. I have lived there since I was 13. ‘I pay council tax, the electricity bills and have spent £42,000 renovating it. It was always my intention to retire in the house. A judge at the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Worcestershire County Council in January. Earlier the High Court (above) had sided with the Walford family . ‘It is quite simply my home and it is going to be sold from underneath me. God knows how many other people will face the same heartache following this ruling.’ In the Court of Appeal hearing on December 9 last year, her barrister Fraser Campbell argued that the only reason his client did not permanently live at Sunnydene was because her work ties her to London. By saying that the house would have been Miss Walford’s residence had she not worked in London, the council was discouraging people over the age of 60 from working, Mr Campbell argued. Despite the submissions, two out of three judges ruled in the council’s favour. Lord Justice McCombe, who rejected the council’s appeal, said he saw ‘no reason’ to assess whether the property was Miss Walford’s home based on a ‘historic’ date. Yesterday a Worcestershire Council spokesman said: ‘This was an important legal challenge and we are pleased that the Court of Appeal ruled in our favour. ‘There are ever increasing demands being made on the public purse and it is important that decisions about how public money is used to support individuals are fair and consistent.’"
969259da64cf9b0dc2baad462561d1c4e203da45,"Manchester United have confirmed their plans to revisit the USA on pre-season this summer after agreeing to Louis van Gaal’s desire to head to America rather than Asia. United’s shirt sponsors Chevrolet are keen for the club to visit the Far East as the American car giant seeks to expand its business in that part of the world and were enthusiastic about that trip taking place this summer. However, after months of discussions between the United board and manager Van Gaal the club will once again head across the Atlantic for a four-game tour signed off by the manager. Manchester United's pre-season tour of the United States will see them play Louis van Gaal's ex-club Barca . The pre-season plans have been organised to Van Gaal's liking after he was unhappy last year in USA . The Premier League giants will face Club America, San Jose Earthquakes, Barcelona and PSG . United will play once again in the International Champions’ Cup, the tournament they won in America last summer. This time, though, with Van Gaal’s influence over all matters of club business growing ever stronger, the club will squeeze four games in to 12 days before heading back to England on July 30 in order to recover in time for the start of the Barclays Premier League season on August 8. July 17 - vs Club America . CenturyLink Field, Seattle - 72,000 capacity . July 21 - vs San Jose Earthquakes . TBC . July 25 - vs Barcelona . Levi's Stadium, California - 68,500 capacity . July 29 - vs Paris Saint-Germain . Soldier Field, Chicago - 61,500 capacity . Van Gaal was furious last summer with the amount of travelling United had to do as they zig-zagged around America, playing games in Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and Miami. This time, United will be based largely on the west coast, playing games against Club America in Seattle, San Jose Earthquakes, at a venue to be announced and Barcelona near San Francisco before facing PSG in Chicago on the way home. As revealed earlier this month in Sportsmail, the tournament organisers have essentially organised this summer’s tournament around United’s needs. For example, there will be no final this year in order to avoid last summer’s rather delicate situation that saw an irritated Van Gaal having to take his team to Miami for four days for a game he really had no desire to play. It is understood that United will use Seattle as their base before their first game this summer. Next summer’s tour, meanwhile, will almost certainly be to Asia, a continent United haven’t visited since David Moyes’ pre-season of 2013. Ander Herrera, David De Gea and Juan Mata (left to right) hold the trophy after beating Liverpool in Miami . The squad reached the final of the 2014 International Champions Cup, but had travelled about 13,500 miles . July 24 - Manchester United 7-0 LA Galaxy (Pasadena) Attendance: 86,432 .

082692d41fdcff3b656daf880289e99088678a12,"The messy divorce between chef Bobby Flay and actress Stephanie March just got uglier. On Sunday, the New York Post's Page Six alleged that the marriage breakup was the result of Flay having an affair with his assistant Elyse Tirrel, who's 28. But the celebrity chef's  business partner Laurence Kretchmer moved swiftly to dismiss the claims, saying that if Flay, 50, had been having an ongoing affair with an employee, he would know about it. Scroll down for video . The other woman? It was alleged Sunday that chef Bobby Flay has been having an affair with his assistant Eliyse Tirrell and that it led to the breakdown of his marriage to Stephanie March . Secret affair: Page Six claimed Flay, 50, has been seeing Tirrel, who's 28, for three years and that according to a friend of March, the actress learned of the relationship with the former hostess just after Thanksgiving 2014 . Page Six reported that Tirrell is a 'singer/actress who worked as a hostess at the chef's Bar Americain in 2008 and became his assistant.' The gossip site claimed that Flay, who filed for divorce from March, 40, in April, has been cheating on the Law & Order:SUV star for three years with  Tirrell. March's friend Maia Madison, a writer and actress, told Page Six that March arrived 'sobbing uncontrollably' at her home just after Thanksgiving after finding out about the affair. Madision went on to say that Tirrell 'is about to ­become the Monica Lewinsky of the food world.' Messy divorce: Flay filed for divorce earlier this month saying that his 10-year marriage to Law & Order: SVU star March has 'irretrievably broken down' After the story ran, Flay's representative released a statement to the media saying: 'We will continue to refrain from responding to the continued efforts by certain parties to spread rumors and innuendo.' 'This specific allegation was in a letter sent from one attorney in this case to the other. It was written and then leaked specifically to try to insert this story into the press, and that’s unfortunate.' The statement continued:: 'Even more unfortunate is that all of this is being done in order to renegotiate a prenuptial agreement that was agreed to over a decade ago and never amended during the marriage.' Kretchmer defended his friend and insisted that none of the claims about an affair with his assistant are based in reality. He is quoted as saying that the young woman is' a great and valued employee.' 'If she had an affair with Bobby it would have been reported to me. That has never even been suggested, and people like to talk,' Kretchmar said. 'Have Bobby and Elyse been seen together? Yes, that’s her job.' He then suggested that there is more mud-slinging to come in the ugly battle between the former couple whom he has known for 14 years. 'As ugly as Stephanie is going to look [when this news comes out], she will look uglier when other things come out,' Kretchmer told Page Six. Bitter battle: March, 40, is contesting the prenuptial agreement the couple signed ahead of their marriage that means the famous chef, who's worth about $20 million, only has to pay her $5,000 a month in alimony . The Food Network chef filed court documents filed on April 10 saying that his 10-year marriage has 'irretrievably broken down.' The actress, though, has mounted a legal challenge to the prenuptial agreement that the now estranged couple signed which says Flay, reported to be wort about $20 million, only has to pay her $5,000 per month. In return, March has accused the chef of 'bullying through economic warfare.' March's lawyer said the famous chef won't let her and her sick mother Laura Derby stay in their $8m marital Manhattan home unless she signs a press release alleging their split was amicable. Happier times: March was Flay's third wife and appeared as a guest judge on several of his Food Network shows. The couple are pictured here in September 2009 in New York City ."
ac20e5bf5a542c078222d1c648e538cce324147a,"Louis Jordan, 37, released a three-paragraph statement on Monday in which he said he stayed inside his cabin to keep dry and avoid sun, wind, waves and sea spray during his ordeal. The man rescued from a disabled sailboat off the North Carolina coast has responded to critics of his story by claiming that he avoided sunburn and blisters by staying in the vessel's cabin and that he survived by rationing food and water. Louis Lordan released a three-paragraph statement on Monday in whcih he said he stayed inside the cabin to keep dry and avoid sun, wind, waves and sea spray. 'Every time I went outside, I exposed myself to getting my clothes drenched, which would have made it harder for me to keep warm,' Jordan said. 'My blankets were already soaked, and often there was no way of hanging up my clothes to dry. Keeping dry was vital to my survival.' Jordan also said he set up a makeshift mast with a small sail to get the boat headed in a westward direction. He said he rationed food and water and kept his calorie expenditure low. 'That meant I had to stay inside the boat as much as possible, therefore I didn't have a sunburn, or blisters, as if I were found clinging to an upside-down boat,' Jordan said. Jordan was spotted by a German-flagged boat on Thursday, more than two months after sailing out of a South Carolina marina. Coast Guard crew members who retrieved him said they were surprised by his fit appearance and overall health. Too good to be true? A surprisingly healthy-looking Louis Jordan pictured soon after  being found off the North Carolina coast on Thursday . Thomas Grenz, the captain of the German tanker ship that spotted Jordan last week and brought him aboard, said Jordan's U.S. passport described him as weighing 290 pounds, but he was probably down to 200 pounds when the crew found him. Officials with the U.S. Coast Guard say it wasn't clear how long after he left the marina in Conway, South Carolina, that his boat first capsized. Jordan's sailboat was upright when the German boat found him. Jordan told his family that he was going into open water to sail and fish, according to his mother, Norma Davis. He told WAVY-TV that he was sailing north when he encountered bad weather. He said he saw a wave crash into his window and that his boat eventually filled with water. The Coast Guard began a search on Feb. 8, but it was abandoned after 10 days. Some sightings of Jordan were reported by other sailors, but they couldn't be confirmed. Jordan's statement thanked the Coast Guard rescuer who dropped down from the helicopter to lift Jordan off the boat. He also thanked Grenz and his crew for turning their ship around to save him. Jordan was spotted by a German-flagged boat on Thursday, more than two months after sailing out of a South Carolina marina. Coast Guard crew members who retrieved him said they were surprised by his fit appearance and overall health . 'Their sacrifice demonstrates that our basic humanity is to care for and protect one another,' Jordan said. ' I'm grateful for all of your support and for your honoring my story. 'I'm writing a book on it now.  All the glory goes to God for answering my prayers so perfectly. God is truly great.'"
0038893054277710fb6eea96fbf21a556bc4e318,"Jeffrey Williams, 20, is accused of shooting and wounding the officers on during a rally on March 12 . The man accused of shooting two police officers during a demonstration in Ferguson has confessed to the crime in a series of phone calls from jail that were recorded. Jeffrey Williams, 20, is accused of shooting and wounding the officers on March 12, during an early-morning rally sparked by the resignation of Ferguson's police chief. All inmates are informed their phone conversations while behind bars are recorded and can be used as evidence against them, but despite the warning Williams spoke freely about the incident in calls made from the St. Louis County Justice Center. In a conversation with his girlfriend, Williams said he was being harassed by a group of people outside Ferguson PD on the night of the shooting . 'Nobody aiming at no police,' Williams said. 'I ran up the hill and he (an unidentified person) shot at the car. ... I shot back,' Williams said in the recordings first obtained by KMOV-TV. In another conversation, Williams expressed concern about a possible lengthy prison sentence. 'Even though I was in the wrong, though, I should have just went the other way,' he said. 'Oh man, now I'm looking at 10 years.' Prosecutors say Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else. Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has said Williams told him he never fired during the protest. Despite being warned that phone calls from prison can be used as evidence, Jeffrey Williams, 20, spoke freely about the March 12 incident in calls made from the St. Louis County Justice Center . Christmas told The Associated Press on Wednesday morning he hadn't heard the audio of the phone conversations, but he stood by what Williams told him. 'My client has maintained to me that he never fired a gun that night,' Christmas said. 'So until I'm able to see evidence that I can distinctly talk to him about, I have to maintain my commitment to the statements that he has made to me.' Christmas was also critical of the justice center for releasing audio that provides potential evidence against Williams. Ferguson has been a focal point since a white police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, on Aug. 9. A grand jury in November declined to indict the former officer, Darren Wilson, who also was cleared of civil rights violations by the U.S. Department of Justice in March. Williams said he was being harassed by a group of people outside Ferguson PD and wasn't aiming at the cops. He also expressed remorse . Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has said Williams told him he never fired during the protest . But a separate DOJ report found widespread racial bias in Ferguson's policing efforts and the municipal court system, which it said was driven by profit mostly extracted from black and low-income residents. Several city officials were fired or resigned following the report. Among those was Police Chief Tom Jackson, and his resignation led several dozen people to protest outside of police headquarters. The demonstration was about to break up when shots rang out. A St. Louis County officer was shot in the shoulder; a Webster Groves officer was hit in the face. Both are expected to fully recover."

Legal battle: The father of Dave Brockie (pictured left and right on stage), the late frontman of the eccentric heavy metal band GWAR, has sued the group claiming they have stolen his son’s ashes, guitars and artwork . Under fire: The lawsuit alleges that the surviving members of GWAR swiped Brockie's guitars, artwork, a gold record, tour souvenirs and even his ashes . The Grammy-nominated band was founded in 1984 and is known for its comically grotesque costumes, stage antics and vulgar lyrics. Brockie was the mastermind of the fantasy-inspired band and its founding member. A lawsuit filed last Thursday by William Brockie, Dave's father and the administrator of his estate, seeks $1million in compensatory damages on top of unspecified punitive damages for alleged breach of contract. Mr Brockie details in the lawsuit, cited by the Courthouse News Service, how in the months following his son's death, his bandmates allegedly swiped his guitars, artwork, a gold record, tour souvenirs and even his ashes. According to court documents, the surviving members of GWAR hauled the loot to the headquarters of their management company, Slave Pit Inc, and locked it in an office.

William Brockie also claims in his suit that his son was never paid for taking part in the band's 2014 Far East tour across Asia and Australia . Immediately following Brockie’s passing, the lawsuit contends, GWAR went to work trying to take over his estate and started a charity in his name without his father's consent. Dave Brockie remained a constant in GWAR over the course of its 30-year-history, though it has had a revolving door of members. In 2011, 34-year-old lead guitarist Cory Smoot was found dead on the band's tour bus.

GWAR, who described themselves as 'Scumdogs of the Universe', released their 13th album last year and recently toured Australia and Japan. Brockie always appeared on stage as an intergalactic humanoid barbarian with devil horns and a meaty-looking face, carrying a long sword called an 'Unt Lick'.

Columbia's Medical and Health Sciences Center . He continued: ‘We provide multiple points of view, including mine, which is offered without conflict of interest. That doesn't sit well with certain agendas which distort the facts.’ Dr Henry Miller of California's Stanford University led the effort and he was the first person to sign the letter, the New York Daily News reported. Miller said: 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. 'I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country. 'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.' He told CBS News that ‘a person who endangers patients and is a menace to public health should not be on the faculty of a prestigious medical institution’. The nine other doctors from across the country included Dr Joel Tepper, a cancer researcher from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and Dr Gilbert Ross of the American Council on Science and Health in New York City. The physicians accused Dr Oz of pushing 'miracle' weight-loss supplements with no scientific proof that they work. The doctors wrote that Oz, for years a world-class Columbia cardiothoracic surgeon, has 'misled and endangered' the public. From left to right, Dr Phil McGraw, financial advisor Suze Orman, host Oprah Winfrey, Dr Mehmet Oz and interior designer Nate Berkus participate in The Oprah Winfrey Show live from Radio City Music Hall in 2010 . The letter read: 'He has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain. 'Thus, Dr Oz is guilty of either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both. The New York Ivy League school responded Thursday, issuing a statement to The Associated Press saying only that the school 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.' Dr Oz first came to public attention as a frequent television guest of Oprah Winfrey. For the past five years, he's been the host of The Dr Oz Show. Last year, he appeared before a US Senate panel that accused him of endorsing products that were medically unsound. At the time, the doctor acknowledged some of the products he advised his viewers to use 'don't have the scientific muster to present as fact.' A show representative did not immediately return a call Thursday from the AP seeking comment. As vice chairman of Columbia's surgery department, Dr Oz still occasionally teaches, said Douglas Levy, spokesman for the Columbia University Medical Center. The controversy did not die down after his testimony. The company behind the""miracle"" diet supplement in question later agreed to pay a $3.5 million settlement over false advertising. A study that purported to prove the product's weight-loss benefits turned out to be based on fraudulent data and was retracted."
46d0d741c56facd28698cdfb62f594dd03f8f123,"A. Alfred Taubman, the self-made Michigan billionaire whose philanthropy and business success — including weaving the enclosed shopping mall into American culture — was clouded by a criminal conviction late in his career, has died aged 91. Taubman,  who donated hundreds of millions of dollars to universities, hospitals and museums, died Friday night at his home of a heart attack, according to son Robert S. Taubman, president and CEO of Taubman Centers, Inc. 'This company and all that you stand for were among the greatest joys of his life,' Robert S. Taubman wrote in a message to the company's employees. Dead at 91: Real estate mogul and Michigan billionaire A. Alfred Taubman  died on Friday night   at his home after a heart attack . 'He was so proud of what this wonderful company he founded 65 years ago has accomplished.' Taubman's business success spanned from real estate and art houses to the hot dog-serving A&W restaurant chain, for which he traveled to Hungary to figure out why the country's sausage was so good. He also became a major backer of stem-cell research. But it was his rearrangement of how people shop — parking lot in front, several stores in one stop close to home — that left a mark on American culture. Taubman Centers, a subsidiary of his Taubman Co., founded in 1950, currently owns and manages 19 regional shopping centers nationwide. 'Everything that excited me that I got interested in, I did,' Taubman told The Associated Press in a 2007 interview. Born January 31, 1942, in Pontiac, Michigan, to German-Jewish immigrants, Taubman worked as a boy at a department store after school near his family's home, which was among the custom houses and commercial buildings developed in the area by his father. He was a freshman at the University of Michigan when he left to serve in World War II, around the time he stopped using his first name, Adolph. When he returned to Ann Arbor to study art and architecture, he created small on-campus businesses to cover expenses, then transferred to Lawrence Technological University near Detroit to take night classes while working at an architectural firm as a junior draftsman. Family business: Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield officially opened in 2013 in Chesterfield, Missouri a western suburb of St. Louis . Recognizing the booming post-war growth of the middle class, particularly in the Motor City, he launched his first real estate development company in 1950. His first project was a freestanding bridal shop in Detroit — but he had his eyes on something bigger. He'd noticed shoppers responding to the convenience of 'one-stop comparison shopping opportunity,' he wrote in his autobiography. So when a friend suggested a shopping plaza in Flint, Taubman's company did something radical for the time: stores were pushed to the back of the lot and parking spaces were put up front. It was a success, his young company took on larger-scale developments in Michigan, California and elsewhere in the 1950s and early '60s. A. Alfred Taubman is assisted as he leaves federal court in New York, on Monday, April 22, 2002 where Taubman was sentenced to a year in jail for fixing commissions at Sotheby's . Taubman served as chairman of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc., parent company of Sotheby's art auction house, from 1983 to 2000, and was a partner in international real estate firm The Athena Group before he was tangled in a price-fixing scheme. He was convicted in 2001 of conspiring with Anthony Tennant, former chairman of Christie's International, to fix the commissions the auction giants charged. Prosecutors alleged sellers were bilked of as much as $400 million in commissions. Taubman was fined $7.5 million and spent about a year in a low-security prison in Rochester, Minnesota, but long insisted he was innocent and expressed regret for not testifying in his own defense. 'I had lost a chunk of my life, my good name and around 27 pounds,' he recalled in his book, saying he was forced to take the fall for others. Mall man: A. Alfred, Robert and William Taubman, along with Randy Benderson and other dignitaries, cut the ribbon today to open The Mall at University Town Center in Sarasota, Florida in 2014 . The case cast a shadow over Taubman's accomplishments, but it diminished over the years — and his philanthropy continued unabated. He had pledged $100 million to the University of Michigan's A. Alfred Taubman Medical Research Institute and its stem-cell research by 2011. He also financed public-policy programs at Harvard, Brown University and the University of Michigan, which received several large donations. He donated millions and spoke passionately in support of the 2008 ballot initiative in Michigan that eased restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research and enabled his namesake institute to conduct major research for diseases — including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, which claimed the life of his good friend, New York Sen. Jacob Javits, in 1986. After turning over control of Taubman Centers to his two sons, Taubman made sustaining the Detroit Institute of Art a priority. His knowledge of how shoppers negotiated malls was tapped to help reconfigure the flow of the museum, and he helped guide the DIA as president of the Detroit Arts Commission through chronic financial problems."
e720bc945919194cab458157c0fe36fbcf73fc29,"Under legal pressure, the Obama administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on a list of tens of thousands of people banned from flying to, from or within the United States. The new policy allows for an American traveler who has been denied boarding a commercial airliner to petition the U.S. Transportation Security Administration once to find out whether he or she is on the no-fly list and a second time for an unclassified explanation of why he or she is on the list. In some cases, the government will not be able to provide an explanation because of national security concerns. The changes partially lift a veil of secrecy enshrouding a policy that has been a centerpiece of the government's counterterrorism efforts since the September 2001 terror attacks. Grounded or not grounded? Under legal pressure, the Obama administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on a list of tens of thousands of people banned from flying to, from or within the U.S. Above the security line at New York John F Kennedy International Airport in October . But the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list in an ongoing federal lawsuit, said the changes don't go far enough in giving travelers the legal due process they are entitled to, including seeing the evidence held against them and getting an opportunity to challenge it. The explanations provided to six travelers so far, which were mandated by a federal judge, have been inadequate, the ACLU said. For instance, in a letter to New Jersey resident Amir Meshal, the government's explanation for his inclusion on the list was based on information the FBI obtained from Meshal when he was detained in Africa in 2007, ACLU attorney Hina Shamsi said. The ACLU considers Meshal's detention to be unlawful and said he suffered abuse. 'From the face of the letter, a neutral decision-maker would have no idea whatsoever that any of that occurred,' said Shamsi. The Justice Department declined to comment on the specific constitutionality challenges because of the ongoing lawsuit. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas said, 'We are committed to a process that protects Americans from terrorist threats while respecting privacy and safeguarding civil liberties.' Last fall, there were about 64,000 people on the no-fly list, according to the government. Typically, less than 5 per cent of those on the list are Americans. The list fluctuates in size. Previously, the government's policy was never to confirm or deny that a person actually is on list, citing national security concerns. In most instances, travelers assume they are on the list because they are instructed to go through additional screening at airports or because they are told they can't board their flights. Travelers have been able to appeal their presumed placement on the list since 2007. Only a small percentage of appeals the government receives each year have been from travelers actually on the list, the government has said. The TSA gets between 15,000 and 20,000 requests a year, and less than 1 per cent of those are actually from people on the no-fly list, said Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron. In 2014, a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, required that the government notify 13 plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list of their status on the list, and seven were told they were not on the list. The government provided explanations to the six plaintiffs it confirmed were on the no-fly list, including Meshal. One of the explanations included just a 'single cryptic sentence about alleged travel to a foreign country,' according a court document filed earlier this year. The letters to the six plaintiffs on the no-fly list have been redacted on the public court docket to protect the plaintiffs' reputations, Shamsi said. 'The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again,' Shamsi said. The TSA will continue to handle the petitions under the new policy. The changes are not yet in effect, and have so far only been applied to the 13 plaintiffs in the Portland lawsuit, but the Homeland Security Department said it expects them be in place soon. Catron said individual requests should take months to process, not years. 'These enhancements continue to ensure that individuals who are deemed to be a threat to our aviation security are prohibited from boarding a flight within, or bound for, the United States,' Catron said."

A Long Island cardiologist had the office of another doctor torched, then hired someone who turned out to be an undercover police officer in a failed attempt to have the doctor hurt or killed, authorities said on Wednesday. Dr. Anthony J. Moschetto allegedly used drugs, guns and blank prescriptions as currency while trying to have the other doctor harmed amid a professional dispute, investigators said. Moschetto first allegedly hired two men to set fire to the man's office; it happened beneath a sprinkler and damage was minimal, prosecutors said. 'He was willing to pay $5,000 to have him beaten and put in the hospital for a couple of months and pay $20,000 to have him killed,' Nassau County Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly said of Moschetto's intentions. 'He wanted to put him out of business so he could get his business.' Moschetto worked with the rival cardiologist at a Great Neck practice on Northern Boulevard before setting up his own practice also in Great Neck, said Assistant District Attorney Ann Donnelly. Acting District Attorney Madeline Singas said 'luckily for this victim,' Moschetto was stopped. Investigators who went to Moschetto's home in Sands Point on Long Island's Gold Coast - one of the nation's wealthiest areas - found a weapons cache in a secret room that was accessed through a motorized bookshelf, they said. The weapons, which included dozens of knives, guns and a hand grenade, were displayed at a news conference Wednesday. The investigation into Moschetto started with his purchase of Oxycodone pills, heroin and two fully loaded assault weapons. Prosecutors said Moschetto had paid the undercover police officer $500 to perform a hit before getting arrested. He was caught on undercover video discussing the alleged plot. Attempt to kill: Cardiologist Anthony Moschetto, 54, pictured on Wednesday after he was arrested on charges he had another doctor's office torched, then hired undercover officers to have the doctor hurt or killed . Press Conference: Acting Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas announces the arrests of Anthony Moschetto, James Kalamaras and James Chmera during a news conference in Mineola on Wednesday . Moschetto faces a maximum sentence of 8 1/3 to 25 years in prison, prosecutors said. Newsday reports that Moschetto's charges include conspiracy, criminal sale of a controlled substance, arson, burglary, weapons possession, criminal sale of a firearm, and criminal solicitation. Two other defendants are charged in the case, accused of their involvement in the office fire, which occurred before the undercover investigation began. They, along with Moschetto, had been arrested Tuesday. Co-defendants James Chmela, 43, of Selden, and James Kalamaras, 41, also were scheduled for arraignment on Wednesday. 'Dr. Moschetto is a hidden monster living in the North Shore area who has no respect for law and life,'  said Nassau County Police Department Acting Commissioner Thomas Krumpter. 'He had enough weapons to provide a small army means to wreak harm.'

Co-conspirators: James Chmela (left) and James Kalamaras (right) were arrested for arson in a related scheme to allegedly destroy the rival doctor's office building, authorities said . Evidence: These knives were allegedly found by authorities in a secret room behind a bookshelf in the doctor's home in Long Island . The Drug Enforcement Administration also was involved in the investigation, which began in December. In asking for $500,000 bond, his Manhattan attorney, Randy Zelin, said Moschetto's attorney asked for a $500,000 bond and said that Moschetto was a 'well respected cardiologist.' 'My client has a wealth of roots in the community and has absolutely no reason to leave his family, to leave his children, and to leave what he has built in this community,' Zelin said.

Louis Jordan, 37, who was rescued 200 miles off the North Carolina coast, said he survived for more than two months on his stricken boat by eating fish he caught by trailing dirty clothes in the ocean, and by catching rainwater in a bucket. But doubters have questioned how Jordan – who declined medical help despite claiming to have broken a shoulder and who appears well-fed, with pale, unblemished skin – seemed in such good shape after such a gruelling ordeal. Scroll down for video . Louis Jordan, second from left, walks from the Coast Guard helicopter to the Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. He left hours later after he refused treatment . Doubters of Jordan's ordeal say  that despite claiming to have broken a shoulder, he appeared to be well-fed, with pale, unblemished skin . Rebutting his critics for the first time yesterday in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘God knows I am a truthful man. My family knows I am telling the truth. The people who know me know that.’ He added that the authorities had checked he had not withdrawn money from his bank account when he first went missing, though they will now scrutinise his credit card and bank statements for any activity during the period he says he was drifting. Jordan said his morale was boosted by reading the Bible from cover to cover, but claimed he lost 50 lbs after his supply of tinned food ran out and his diet was reduced to raw fish. He also gave colourful examples of his experiences, from encounters with two killer whales who had ‘such beautiful faces, they looked so friendly’, to sailing through shoals of glowing phosphorescent jellyfish at night. Jordan pictured on his 35-foot boat, which during one storm in which Jordan claims he broke his shoulder, lost its mast, rudder and radio . Jordan had been living on his docked sailboat in Conway, South Carolina, before he told his family he was 'going into the open water' to go fishing more than two months ago . Jordan, an amateur sailor who had been living on his boat, the 35 ft Angel, set off on a fishing trip from Conway, South Carolina, on January 23. He was reported missing six days later. The sailor claims he broke his shoulder during one of the three times his boat was knocked over in heavy seas – destroying the mast, rudder and radio – yet he has shown no obvious sign of injury. Last night a US Coast Guard spokesman said: ‘We don’t have any reason to doubt him but nor can we confirm he spent all this time out there. We are looking forward to learning more about what exactly happened. We are as keen as anyone to find out the truth.’ Survival expert Erik Kulik, of the True North Wilderness Survival School, said: ‘I would have expected him to be severely dehydrated. After refusing treatment at the hospital, Jordan when right into taking part in television interviews about his experience . ‘After that amount of time at sea he would have been wobbly on his feet and yet he seemed to walk perfectly. He says he broke his right shoulder and yet he didn’t even seem to be guarding that shoulder in the pictures I saw after the rescue. There is a lot that doesn’t add up.’ Jordan, who was rescued on Thursday, said his shoulder injury had healed, adding: ‘I have a bump but it’s fine. I feel no pain right now. After two months at sea it healed.’ He said he survived through ‘lots of prayer’, reading the End Time Prophecies and catching seaweed, crabs and fish by trailing dirty laundry off the hull. He said: ‘One day I caught a jellyfish and I know you can eat some types of jellyfish. I put it to my lips and it stung so badly...I spat it out. I had to put charcoal in my mouth for 45 minutes to suck out the toxin.’ He added: ‘I don’t mind being criticised. To paraphrase the Bible – fools hate to be criticised but wise men love to be criticised.’ A U.S. Coast Guard crew rescued Jordan by helicopter and said that he was smiling when they arrived .

Mariah rejected Nick's numerous demands for a $30 million divorce settlement so now he's writing the book — saying he plans get his payday for being married to her one way or another - and there is nothing she can do about it because he already signed the deal last week with major publishing company Simon and Schuster. Simon & Schuster has confirmed to Daily Mail Online that the book is being published by Gallery Books, an imprint of the high-powered publisher.

Now Nick is being very vengeful, dating other women in public including Nicole Murphy, Michael Strahan's ex, the source says. 'Mariah kept telling Nick she was not going to give him a penny more than $10 million,'  says the friend.

Nick hardly needs Mariah's money- although she is worth more than ten times his value. The actor and host of America's Got Talent has an estimated net worth of $20 million. Mariah is worth about $225 million. The estranged stars have been going back and forth about this since Nick filed for divorce in December. He was finally tired of arguing with her. ''He says she is being unreasonable so he has to do what he has to do. 'Now Mariah is angry, devastated and scared that Nick will reveal her inner most secrets and make her look like a desperate fool.' Mariah was crazy about Nick and trusted him with everything in her life but, now she feels he has turned out like every other man in her life and she is completely crushed, the friend reveals. Mariah, 45, and Nick, 34, have been battling about money and custody of their twins since he filed the divorce papers four months ago and even though there is a prenuptial agreement Nick is willing to air their dirty laundry — for a big fat check. US singer Marih Carey and her husband, US movie maker and actor Nick Cannon, leave the hotel to have a dinner at the Eiffel Tower in 2012 to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary . Battle for the babies: Who gets custody of twins Monoe and Moroccan Cannon is another issue in the divorce battle . Mariah and Nick were married on her private estate in the Bahamas on April 30, 2008 and they welcomed their twins Monroe and Moroccan on April 30, 2011. However, in August 2014, Nick confirmed that he and his wife, Mariah had been separated for a few months and he filed for divorce on December 12, 2014. 'Nick says he is going to tell the world about Mariah's drug use, her strange eating habits, psychosis, what she has said about other artists, her sexual proclivities and her parenting skills. It which will really be hurtful,' the insider continued. 'And Nick is also going to explain why he thinks he should have full custody of the twins. Mariah has admitted she never wanted children and Nick is going to tell the world why she felt that way. 'If Nick was not willing to spill all of their nasty and salacious secrets he would not have gotten a book deal. So obviously, Simon and Schuster feel this is going to be a blockbuster and they signed him up.'"
b0091b4365b8693b8631d0f8fa4514a4f9edd1df,"Carlos Tevez talks about being as free as a bird, back to the days when he was banging in the goals in Argentina for Boca Juniors. A big hit on the famous steeped terracing at La Bombonera as he followed in the footsteps of Diego Maradona, Claudio Cannigia and some of the other greats. Here in Turin he is worshipped at the Juventus Stadium, one of the idols in the shirt of the Bianconeri with that fearless, wholehearted approach to the game. Carlos Tevez (left) is worshipped by Juventus fans and has scored six Champions League goals this season . The Italian side are aiming to beat Monaco on Tuesday in their Champions League quarter-final first leg . On Tuesday evening, with six goals already in this season’s Champions League, he will be expected to deliver in the first leg of the quarter-final against Monaco. Juve are already on course for the Serie A title, 12 points clear of nearest rivals Lazio ahead of their meeting in the league this weekend. First though, Massimiliano Allegri’s team must find a way to beat Monaco, to secure a decent first-leg lead against the surprise quarter-finalists before the return in the Stade Louis II. At 31 Tevez appears to be enjoying his football again, helping Juventus to the title last season and leading the assault on the Champions League this term. Massimiliano Allegri is hoping to end 19 years of Champions League hurt by taking Juventus to glory . Monaco stand in Juventus' way; they were adventurous and audacious in their win over Arsenal in the last 16 . It is easy to knock Italian football, to place it behind England, Spain and Germany, but to do that would do a great disservice to this Juventus team. There are some formidable talents in there, with Gianluigi Buffon protected in his goal by the tough, uncompromising presence of Giorgio Chiellini, Andrea Barzagli and Leonardo Bonucci in their three-man defence. The prolonged absence of Andrea Pirlo, who has made five appearances in this season’s competition, has given others a chance to excel in the centre of this Juve midfield. Paul Pogba, one of the summer targets for Manchester United, is missing but Arturo Vidal, Roberto Pereyra and Claudio Marchisio all have pedigree. Tevez admits he feels free at Juventus, back to the days when he was playing for Boca Juniors (pictured) Monaco players train at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on the eve of their Champions League quarter-final . It has been 12 years since they last reached the Champions League final, when they were beaten by Milan on penalties during a dreadful stalemate that finished 0-0 at Old Trafford. For supporters of Juve it has been too long, with the shootout victory over Ajax in 1996 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome a distant memory. They have won the European Cup twice and would dearly love a third. Standing in their way of a semi-final appearance is Monaco, the surprise team to make it through after their remarkable win over Arsenal in the previous round. At the Emirates, Leonardo Jardim’s team were adventurous and audacious, surprising Arsenal with their breathtaking approach to the game. They are not to be underestimated. Gianluca Vialli lifts the Champions League for Juventus in 1996 - the last time the Bianconeri were victorious . In 2003, Juventus suffered heartbreak in the Champions League final, losing to AC Milan in a penalty shootout . Despite the big, high-profile exits of James Rodriguez to Real Madrid and Radamel Falcao’s season-long loan to Manchester United, they are difficult to beat. Joao Moutinho is a classy player in the centre of their midfield and the France international Jeremy Toulalan can always pick out a pass. Up front is Dimitar Berbatov, one of the scorers at the Emirates on the night of that incredible and climactic 3-1 victory in the first leg. Dimitar Berbatov is one of the men standing in Juventus' way in their Champions League quarter-final . Tevez is adored by Juventus supporters and they will hope he is the man to help them to European glory . It was after that game when Arsene Wenger headed straight for the tunnel, failing to shake the hand of Monaco’s Portuguese coach following Arsenal’s defeat. When Monaco scraped through on away goals, Jardim made a point of calling Wenger ‘disrespectful’ for his behaviour, which is familiar to all English football fans, on the touchline. Here in Turin, the Monaco coach talked of being worthy of their place in the quarter-final, good enough to live with the very best teams left in the tournament. Now, inside this magnificent new stadium, they get to meet one of them."
3e4d4b1ac0bbfb664bd2fc38e380c08e4800b418,"Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's relieved Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been found guilty of carrying out the Boston bombing - the greatest tragedy in her state's recent history - but doesn't believe he should be executed. In an interview with CBS This Morning on Thursday, Warren reacted to Wednesday's jury verdict which found the 21-year-old guilty on all 30 charges related to the Boston Marathon explosions which killed three and injured hundreds at the finish line. 'Nothing is ever going to make those who were injured whole and it's been a terrible thing but this is a step toward justice,' Warren said. When asked what she would like to see happen in the penalty stage of the trial, liberal-minded Warren stuck by her anti-death penalty stance. 'My heart goes out to the families here but I don't support the death penalty. I think that he should spend his life in jail - no possibility of parole - he should die in prison. But that's just how I see it. It's up to the jury,' she said. Scroll down for video . Life in prison: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Thursday that she doesn't believe convicted Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death. Warren pictured left on CBS This Morning on Thursday. Tsarnaev pictured right in Boston federal court on Wednesday as his guilty verdict was read . Warren went on to speak about current Democratic party issues, as well as comment and likely presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. However, the woman once thought to be a front-runner for her party refused to compare her politics to the former secretary of state. Warren has repeatedly denied that she will run in the Democratic primaries. Now that Tsarnaev has been found guilty of committing the Boston Marathon bombings, the case will move on to the penalty stage of the trail which could begin as early as Monday. It is in this stage of the trial that the jury will decide whether or not to sentence Tsarnaev to life in prison or the death penalty - a matter in which they will have to vote unanimously. Justice: Boston Marathon bombing survivor Karen Brassard, second from left, speaks alongside Carlos Arredondo, left, Laurie Scher, second from right, and Mike Ward, on Wednesday following the conviction of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev . While the defense rarely cross-examined witnesses in the first portion of the trial, they will be more active in the next stage as they attempt to convince the jury against sentencing Tsarnaev to death. One thing Tsarnaev's favor is his lead defense attorney Judy Clarke, who specializes in death penalty cases and spared notorious killers like Unabomber Ted Kaczynski from execution. Clarke's method is to humanize her client to the jury, with stories about their life which might explain what led them to commit such heinous crimes. In the first portion of the trial, the defense alluded to an argument that then 19-year-old Tsarnaev was influenced by his radicalized older brother Tamerlan. Attorneys will likely continue that storyline with this next phase of the trial, exploring the brothers relationship, their childhood in Soviet Russia and Kyrgzstan and their later immigration to the U.S. with their parents. However, legal experts say saving Tsarnaev from the death penalty will be her toughest job yet. Secret weapon: Tsarnaev's lead defense attorney, Judy Clarke, specializes in death penalty cases and has spared several of her notorious killer clients from execution by humanizing them to the jury. Pictured above leaving court on Wednesday, after hearing the guilty verdict for Tsarnaev . 'I haven't yet heard all the mitigating factors you'd expect to hear. In traditional death penalty cases, it's physical abuse, sexual abuse, drug abuse, dropping out of school,' Meg Penrose, a death penalty expert at Texas A&M University School of Law, said. However, Tsarnaev has yet another advantage of being put on trial in Massachusetts since the state outlawed capital punishment in 1984. While the death penalty is not allowed in state cases, Tsarnaev is being tried in federal court which makes the death penalty a possible sentencing option. However, experts say that since the jury was pulled from a pool of Massachusetts residents, they could decided against the death penalty as a reflection of the state's general politics on the issue. The prosecution will also have to convince the jury while Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death, proving that the crime was carried out with certain aggravating factors that warrant execution. So far they've listed such factors as killing a child and planning the attack for the day of the Marathon to maximize the loss of life."

Summer Michelle Hansen, 32, of California entered a guilty plea in February to 16 felony counts related to the sex acts which included seven counts of oral copulation of a minor, six counts of statutory rape and three counts of distributing pornographic material to a child, according to NBC. The mother of three was told during the sentencing on Friday that she must also register as a sex offender for life. Parents of the victims were upset that Hansen's plea agreement was approved, which was made directly to Riverside County Superior Court Judge Becky Dugan. If she had been convicted at trial, Hansen would have faced 13 years in prison. Scroll down for video . Summer Michelle Hansen (above in court during her sentencing on Friday), 32, was sentenced on Friday to three years in state prison and must also register as a sex offender for life . Parents of the victims were disappointed that the judge approved Hansen's plea agreement, as she could have faced 13 years in prison if convicted at trial . Hansen entered a guilty plea in February to the 16 felony counts related to sex acts with her five male students . Judge  Dugan said she took into consideration factors such as the former teacher's admittance of guilt and lack of prior criminal history when deciding on an appropriate sentence. In court on Friday, the judge told Hansen: 'You're a mother yourself. It's beyond me to understand your behavior.' Deputy District Attorney Kimberly Williams said that her office opposed the length of the sentence proposed by the judge but that she was happy to see Hansen take responsibility for her actions, according to the Press Enterprise. Hansen made an emotional plea to the victims' families while in court saying she prayed for them every night and that she was 'heartbroken', according to KTLA. 'I'm not a monster. I made bad choices in life and for that I'm truly, truly sorry,' Hansen said through tears. The ex-teacher came under investigation two years ago after a former student at Centennial High School came forward to say he had sex with Hansen, and she was arrested in June 2013. Prosecutors said the crimes took place in her classroom, a school utility room, her car and at one victim's home between May 2012 and 2013, according to KTLA. It is not believed that the students were taught by her at the time but all were under the age of 18. Hansen, (left and right) was a special education instructor at Centennial High School. She was officially terminated on Friday by the Corona-Norco Unified School District . In court Hansen made an emotional plea to the victims' parents and said: 'I'm not a monster. I made bad choices in life and for that I'm truly, truly sorry' Court documents revealed that the sex related acts included Hansen having oral sex with a student who was in her classroom for Saturday school, sending students texts with pictures of herself naked, and having sex with two students while on campus, according to NBC. On Friday, one of the victim's mother referred to Hansen as a 'predator' in court and said she 'stalked my child in the sanctuary of a school'. The mother also said she was disappointed in the judicial system that gave Hansen a 'ridiculously low offer'. One of the victims' mothers said she was disappointed with the 'ridiculously low offer' given during the sentencing to Hansen (above pictured in court last May) Hansen was under investigation after a student came forward and said he had sex with her. She was arrested in June 2013 and prosecutors said the crimes occurred between 2012 and 2013 . Another parent said the three-year sentence was 'a slap in the face' for the victims. Hansen was  was placed on administrative leave following her arrest while officials tried to determine how many students she had sex with, and she was officially terminated on Friday by the Corona-Norco Unified School District. Parents at the school were stunned by the arrest two years ago. 'It surprises me that any 31-year-old . adult, married woman is having sex with a child, teacher or otherwise,' said parent Angela Thompson at the time. Staff at Centennial High School (pictured) in Corona notified police to Hansen's alleged inappropriate relationships ."
e6d41d3e16525d484a10513851cb0a09c7875678,"Sam Allardyce has warned Brendan Rodgers that putting Raheem Sterling on a bumper new contract could cause a ripple effect across the rest of the Liverpool squad. The West Ham manager feels paying Sterling more than the £100,000-per-week deal he was already offered would lead to the 20-year-old's team-mates demanding more. Yet Allardyce does not blame Sterling, currently on £35,000 a week at Liverpool, for trying to get as much as possible. Big Sam feels there are so few talented youngsters emerging that clubs are willing to pay extraordinary wages to sign any available. Liverpool and England star Raheem Sterling has stalled over signing a new contract at the Anfield club . Sam Allardyce believes that giving Sterling a bumper deal could risk unsettling the other Liverpool players . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (right) is extremely keen to keep hold of one of the club's best players . 'When the supply is far less than the demand, then you've got very big demands from the youngster, who is a very talented youngster because there are not enough about,' Allardyce said. 'Not just in the country but in Europe in general, if not in the world. 'The demand is out there. The supply is minimal. A lot less than we want it to be. Hence that gives it a value. When that comes around it's very difficult for a football club not to pay that level of finance that they then demand. 'It reflects down the way from there on in, by the fact that the more the money goes up at the top end the more everybody else wants going down below that.' Allardyce feels if a club were to buy the England international, who currently has two years left on his contract at Liverpool, then they would not only be getting a player, but a brand. 'If a player is in his position like Raheem Sterling, then you're going to look at his value,' Allardyce added. 'Not just his value on the pitch but his value in branding. 'You have to remember that we're hitting 950 million viewers every weekend. The agents and his advisers look at the value of that to the football club, and the value of that to him and their brand, and they ask for that sort of money.' Sterling drags the ball back ahead of the oncoming challenge from Lithuania's Georgas Freidgeimas (left) Sterling scored his first goal for England during the 4-0 win in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania . Big Sam was speaking ahead of West Ham's match with the Barclays Premier League's bottom-club Leicester City on Saturday. The game will see Allardyce reunited with Leicester manager Nigel Pearson after they worked together at Newcastle United in 2007. Pearson has been involved in several controversial incidents this season, including grabbing Crystal Palace's James McArthur by the throat and losing his cool with a reporter during a press conference. It added to speculation Pearson will be sacked but Allardyce defended the man that was once a coach under him at St James' Park. 'Nigel was there (at Newcastle) when I arrived and we worked very well together in that short period of time,' Allardyce said. 'I always thought he was management material and I think he left just after I left, then moved into management and has been very successful. 'I suppose in the end Nigel is a very, very, very, very honest man. He says it how it is. Perhaps that's sometimes the wrong thing to do publicly, but he knows who he is. He knows what he wants. He knows how to try to achieve it.' Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson (left) has been involved in a number of controversial incidents this season ."
0246ddab6a44f81d1b3cfb6d8f3c156d1096158f,"Wayne Rooney knows Champions League qualification is Manchester United's to lose, making this weekend's clash with Aston Villa all the more important. Louis van Gaal's side sit fourth in the Barclays Premier League standings as the season enters the closing stages, boasting a five-point cushion over the chasing pack after winning so impressively at Liverpool before the international break. Juan Mata's brace earned United a deserved 2-1 triumph at Anfield to give them a buffer over the Reds, as well as fellow top-four contenders Southampton and Tottenham. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney feels the club are on course to qualify for the Champions League . United midfielder Juan Mata scored a fantastic brace against Liverpool to secure his side a 2-1 win at Anfield . The second of Mata's goals was a brilliant improvised scissor kick to give United a 2-0 lead in the second-half . However, Rooney is well aware how quickly things can change, admitting nothing less than victory will suffice when Aston Villa come to Aston Villa on Saturday. 'Yes it was (a six-pointer at Liverpool), but that means nothing if we don't beat Aston Villa on Saturday,' the United captain said. 'Obviously Arsenal play Liverpool as well, so if we can get the win against Villa that will be an even better result than Liverpool was for us. 'I think there are still eight games left. We are in a good position at the minute so it's in our own hands, so have to make sure we do it.' Rooney and several of his United team-mates only returned home from international duty on Wednesday afternoon after a technical fault on the England team plane delayed their departure from Turin. It meant an extra night in Italy, where it looked like they would be leaving after a night to forget as Graziano Pelle punished the Three Lions' poor first-half display. However, Andros Townsend's wonder strike saw England secure a 1-1 draw following a much-improved performance after half-time, when Roy Hodgson's bold substitutions paid off - as did his decision to partner Rooney with full debutant Harry Kane. The England skipper had spent the first half in midfield role as Hodgson tinkered with his side, although he is not allowing that experimentation to be an excuse. 'I think it's important in tournament football you might need that, so that's what we were doing,' the 29-year-old said. Rooney competes for the ball with Italy defender Andrea Ranocchia during Tuesday's international friendly . Rooney runs forward with the ball during the friendly match at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on Tuesday . 'We were trying a few different things out because you never know with injuries and suspensions in tournament football. The best time to do it is obviously in the friendlies. 'You could clearly see in the first half that it didn't work so I think the manager made good changes at the right time which helped us to get back into the game. 'Obviously I haven't played in midfield for a few weeks. Sometimes it is difficult to go from up front to midfield or from midfield to up front - sometimes it does take time. 'I had a few chances and could have scored, so I felt I played better when I went up front.' United team-mate Phil Jones was another to struggle away from his preferred position, looking lost at times at the base of the diamond. He looked more assured when he dropped back into defence after Chris Smalling complained of feeling unwell and was replaced by Michael Carrick late in the opening period. The 33-year-old had not played for England since October 2013 before these matches and Rooney loves having his club-mate around. 'I felt Michael Carrick was the best player on the pitch by a mile,' he said. 'He gave us great composure, he slowed the game down when we needed to and started our attacks really well.' Asked if Carrick has been under-rated throughout his career, Rooney said: 'Not from me and certainly not from Manchester United fans. 'I think he is a fantastic player. He has been a big reason why, at United, we have won so many trophies over the last few years. So from myself and his team-mates, he has not been under-estimated.' United and England midfielder Michael Carrick has been singled out for his strong performance against Italy ."

As the man reached into the till Bishop tried to swat his hand away. When that didn't stop him, she started punching him in the head multiple times . Bishop said it was 'just a reaction', an instinct to protect the store. 'I love my bosses here, so a couple hundred bucks gets stolen, that's damage to the store and everyone's paycheck,' she said . 'I didn't want him to take my store's money, it was just a reaction,' Bishop told KIRO TV. 'It hurt, but you have adrenaline so you don't really think about it.' The robber punched Bishop right back, and that's when she said he managed to steal $280 from the cash register, according to Komo News. And yet the teenager remained unfazed. As the robber fled out the door she immediately ran after him. Bishop continued to chase the robber through the strip mall's parking lot, warning people nearby that he had a gun.

f49698c8662bc06d2b830968f9724998f28e6d22,"They were the heartbreaking scenes of a family being torn apart: four young sisters being dragged kicking and screaming from their mother's home in the middle of the night. The story was that the girls had been taken from their abusive father back in Italy to hide out in Australia and now they were being sent back to the 'monster' against their will. The scenes of the girl's forced return caused widespread outcry, particularly as the girls' mother portrayed the cruelty of the Dad, and the girls -  then aged nine to 14 years old - frightened and distraught. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Flashback to 2012: These were the heartbreaking scenes of a family being torn apart when four young sisters were dragged kicking and screaming from their mother's Sunshine Coast home in the middle of the night and forced onto a plan back to their father in Italy . The four Vincenti sisters, including the two older girls Emil and Claire, had a 'monster' of a father who abused them and their mother,or so the story went after the girls were removed from their home in dramatic circumstances and return to Italy . What had led up to the removal of the four sistersin Australia and their return to Italy was the fact that their mother had taken them from their home in Italy on a 'vacation' and never returned, claiming the girls' father Tomaso was an abuser . Laura Garrett (pictured) has consistently maintained that she was removing her daughters from Italy back to Australia for their own safety . That was in 2012 and it seemed unbelievable to many Australians who watched the scenes play out that the girls were legally being returned to their Italian father as approved under Italian law. What had been lost in the drama was the fact that the four sisters had earlier been taken by their mother from Italy without the knowledge or permission of that father, Tomaso Vincenti, and that the girls had been born in Italy and spent the greater part of their young lives there. Now 60 Minutes has returned to the village near Florence where the girls have been living with their Italian Dad and interview the two elder girls, Emily and Claire Vincenti and talked to them about their lives and the dramatic circumstances in which they were apparently wrenched from their mother, Laura Garrett. This scene of one of the Tomaso girls in apparent distress outside her father's villa in Florence after the four sisters were taken back from Australia to Italy . Emily and Claire Vincenti (pictured) are now aged 16 and 17 and are living in Italy with their father . Emily and Claire talked about their parents and were filmed going out with their Italian boyfriends in Florence . The four Vinceni girls miss Australia and their mother, but appear happy and calm in contrast to the dramatic and hysterical scenes in which they were removed from Australian in late 2012 . The girls are living positive and fruitful lives, attending school six days a week, talking about what they will study at university and going out with their Italian boyfriends in Florence, according to the programme. Despite claims by the girls' mother than they were not happy in Italy, the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with father Tomaso . The dramatic turn in the lives of the Vincenti girls began in 2010, when they left Italy ostensibly just for  month's holiday back in Australia, with their mother's family on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. Laura Garrett and Tomaso Vincenti had met when she was a schoolgirl and had gone to Italy as an exchange student. Her host family was Tomaso's parents and Laura and Tomaso fell in love. Laura became pregnant and the pair married. Ms Garrett gave birth to four healthy girls, but in 2007 when the youngest was only around  four years old she split from Tomaso. Under Italian law, both parents were granted equal custody. In 2010, Laura told Tomaso she wanted to take the girls back to Australia for a vacation. Ms Garrett told the Australian embassy in Italian entirely different story, that she was fleeing an abusive husband and father and she needed their assistance. Once back in Australia, Ms Garrett and her daughters settled down to life in Queensland for two years, until the dramatic scenes which saw them returned to Italy. Now aged twelve to 17, the young women behave in complete contrast to the screaming, hysterical girls captured on camera in 2012. Just a day after being taken to their father's villa on the outskirts of Florence, the two older girls were filmed running to the front gates when they saw media camped outside and pleaded for reporters to help them return to Australia. The eldest girl was taken back inside by her father, while her sister clung to the gate as her grandmother urged her to return inside. She held onto the gate for an hour, during which local police and social workers arrived. The girls had not seen their mother since they left Australia, but after 60 Minutes went to Italy to film the story, Laura Garrett  has subsequently turned up for a three-day visit. Ms Garrett has previously said in the years since her daughter's return to Italy that the girls were unhappy. 'They don't seem to be settling,' she said in 2013. 'I keep getting constant requests from them to come home.' This edition of 60 Minutes will screen nationally on Channel 9 at 8.30pm this Sunday, April 12 ."

The officer, Ben Johnson, who has been on the force four years, was answering reports of a drunk woman inside Deluxe Nails at a strip mall in Red Rock on Tuesday. When he arrived, he contained 27-year-old Viviana Keith, who was walking toward her car, and began handcuffing her. Johnson claims the woman started resisting him, forcing him to pull a fast and forceful take-down, however video taken on his cash cam and by a person in a nearby shop appear to show a different story. Investigation: Police in Red Rock, Texas, are into this video to see if officer Ben Johnson used excessive force when taking down Viviana Keith, 27, who was arrested amid reports of drunken behavior and DUI . Excessive?: The dramatic video shows the moment Johnson slams Keith into the ground, knocking her out . Take-down: Johnson says that Keith was resisting him, so he threw her to the concrete of the parking lot . Out: The move immediately knocked Viviana Keith unconscious, as her daughter (left) watched on . Battered: Vivian Keith, seen here in her booking photo following the incident on Tuesday, has been charged with DWI with a child younger than 15 and interfering with pubic duties . Both videos show Johnson throwing Keith to the concrete ground of the parking lot. Her head can be seen hitting the hard surface in the video taken nearby, and she passes out on impact. The main who took the video, who wished to remain anonymous, said he believed it was an excessive use of force. 'When I look back at the tape, I can see her head bounce off the concrete because when he threw her down, she wasn't able to brace herself,' the man told KVUE. 'She was absolutely unconscious. 'There were a couple of other gentleman in the store with me and we were saying 'is she breathing?' 'Because at first we weren't seeing her stomach rise and fall.' Another witness, Viviana Garcia, said she thought the woman had died. Furthermore, the woman's daughter, who is six-years-old, also saw the incident unfold. 'It looked like she was dead,' Garcia told the network. 'The little girl was screaming, ''Mommy, mommy''.' Dash cam: A second roll of footage was captured inside Johnson's car showing Keith being arrested . Resisting?: Johnson claimed that Keith resisted him and that he was forced to take her down . Slam: This is the moment officer Ben Johnson throws Viviana Keith to the ground during the arrest Tuesday . Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks said the calls his department received about Keith said she was being 'very combative, very argumentative and also very intoxicated'. Callers also said that Keith had left her daughter in the car. They said she was driving 'erratic' and 'carelessly' when she arrived. Others claimed to have spoken to the daughter, who said she was hungry. Internal investigation: Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks says he has reviewed the footage and believes Johnson acted within his rights . After seeing the footage, Banks said he thinks the officer acted in the right way. 'The officer was very professional, was talking to her calm, he wasn't excited, he wasn't angry,' Banks told KVUE. 'It's unfortunate, the fact that this lady did what appears to hit her head and was knocked unconscious, but I'll tell you, the officer did what he was supposed to do in a situation like that.' Keith was arrested and charged with DWI with a child younger than 15 and interfering with pubic duties. She is being kept at Williamson County Jail for the time being. The incident is being investigated, and Johnson remains on the job."
c1de892aefd7aa1c6c0ad980039252b8c41f208b,"The daughter of Chicago socialite Sheila Von Wiese-Mack accused of brutally murdering her mother during a Bali vacation will turn over a 'significant percentage' of her $1.3million trust fund to care for her newborn daughter. Vanessa Favia, attorney for 19-year-old Heather Mack, has filed court documents for her client agreeing to turn over funds for the care of four-month-old Stella. CBS reports the petition asks for around a half a million dollars to be transferred to Stella, who was born in Kerobakan Prison and who has urgent needs, including clothing and baby wipes. Scroll down for video . Child care: A US-based attorney for Heather Mack, 19, who is accused of murdering her socialite mother in Bali, has filed for about half a million dollars to be transferred to Mack's daughter Stella from Mack's trust fund . Heather Mack smiles at her baby daughter Stella before her sentencing hearing in Denpasar, Bali, in March . Mack wept as prosecutors said she should be sentenced to 15 years - but spared her the death penalty . 'What ever your opinion of the adults in this case, I believe everyone would agree that the baby bears no culpability in this truly sad affair,' Favia said in a press release. Mack filed a claim in court back in February that her uncle, Wiese-Mack's brother and trustee of her estate, had blocked her access to the funds, according to NBC. A judge ordered $150,000 be released to pay for Mack's defense, along with another $2,240 for living expenses, but required that Mack not share the money with anyone. Indonesian officials accused Mack of helping her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, murder her mother at a luxury Bali hotel before stuffing her body in a suitcase last August. The pair are awaiting sentencing, with prosecutors having asked for a sentence of 15 years for Mack and 18 for Schaefer. Chief Prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya said Mack 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother,' but wanted her to be spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby.' The 21-year-old gazes at his baby daughter, held by a relative, before his sentence demand hearing . Mack claimed her daughter - who had to return to hospital shortly after her birth with jaundice - has six fingers on her left hand . Since being held in jail, the 19-year-old from Chicago has been keeping her newborn Stella with her in the crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison. In a bizarre comment from her holding cell last week, Mack said with a grin that Stella has six fingers on her left hand, saying, 'But don't worry, she's OK, thank you.' As she waited in the cell, nervously puffing on a cigarette, Mack added that she and her co-accused boyfriend were married 'in spirit.' She said: 'He has made us a ring each to wear from his side of the prison.' She held up a hand revealing a red plastic ring. 'Tommy's is blue,' she added. Jail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime. Schaefer has admitted to hitting Wiese-Mack with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the trunk of a taxi they had ordered. The couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit. They tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel. Mack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel. Mack, who said during an earlier court hearing that she did not wish her mother dead, said they panicked after Schaefer’s attack with the metal bowl. She said they thought about either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the US Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one. When the prison gates opened to allow the couple to exit last month, onlookers were surprised to see Schaefer carrying baby Stella - the first time he had been seen with her . Shortly after the baby's birth Mack was being accused by prison sources of failing to wash the child properly . Mack said she intended to continue breastfeeding for two years. The baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice. The child was later allowed to be taken back to the prison with her mother. Mack is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell - which she is sharing with eight other women - until the child is two years old. She revealed there was another prison baby, aged seven months, in a separate cell."

The mother-of-four had her first experience of depression as a child and has suffered attacks throughout her adult life. Things were so difficult at one point that she planned to crash her car into a brick wall. And in an interview with The Telegraph on Saturday the 57-year-old revealed how close she came to suicide one day after her divorce from first husband Clive Jones. Scroll down for video . Presenter Fern Britton, who suffers from depression, has revealed how close she came to suicide following her divorce from first husband Clive Jones . The presenter and author, who has been married to her second husband TV chef Phil Vickery, 53, for fifteen years, claims she knew the marriage was never right, but remembers the time after the divorce being particularly bleak. Fern, who had three children with  Clive, twins Harry and Jack, 21, and Grace, 18, and has another daughter, Winifred, 13, with Phil, said: 'I remember very clearly, when they were all little and sitting around the table, all shiny-faced and having their supper, and I'd think: ""Right, you've got everything you want. Lovely! Now I'm just going to pop upstairs and kill myself."" ' Meeting Phil whilst working on Ready, Steady, Cook was something of a salvation for the blonde, who finally came off anti-depressants last year but admits she is fully expecting to go back on them when she has another episode. Fern and husband Phil Vickery will celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary next month . The couple met on the TV food show Ready, Steady, Cook . At least now she has learned to recognise the signs, telling Good Housekeeping this month: 'I haven’t had an episode for a long time. I’m cross that it’s been there and that it lurks around, but I’ve started to understand it more. I reached a stage where I knew when it was coming, hurtling towards me, and I thought, don’t run away, just stand there, brace yourself, and let it happen. Because I knew it would pass. People who are going through their first or second episode don’t trust that it will pass – but it really will.' Today, as she promotes her sixth novel 'A Good Catch' Fern is happy, positive and looking forward to a bright - and Botox-free - future. Phil, 53, and Fern, 57, have four children between them . The author has declared that she has no interest in cosmetic surgery, deciding instead to grow older gracefully . She has declared that she has no interest in cosmetic surgery, deciding instead to grow older gracefully, telling Bryony Gordon: 'I know I'm never going to look the way I did when I was 25, but I know I could look very odd. So this is what 57 is, and this is what 57 looks like. 'I'm going to stop looking back and only look forward. I've got. what, 25 years left? I'm going to enjoy them. I'm going to cycle until I am 70. I'm not going to get Botox or have things done. I'm going to show my children that this is what humans do: we get older.' The keen cyclist, who starts a three-week cycle from John O'Groats to Land's End to raise money for Genesis Research Trust next week, insists that being fit is more important to her than looking younger, saying: 'My bosoms are dropping? Blah, that's life! I am vain about being as fit as I can be – not about my wrinkles. I’ve had that conversation with myself about, should I do Botox, should I do this, should I do that – and I’ve talked myself out of it. I’d prefer to be the woman I should be. I’m 57, and I look like a 57 year-old, and I’m happy.'"
d6020c6699dafa641cb128fe666f17a0b26d2d34,"We know him as 'Success Kid' - the toddler with a clenched fist and look of satisfaction who's become the internet's most positive meme. But now Sam Griner is eight years old and is using his online fame to help out his sick dad. His mother, Laney Griner from Jacksonville, Florida, set up a GoFundMe page to raise the $75,000 her husband, Justin, needs for the kidney transplant and years of subsequent medications. 'Please help us reach our goal so that Justin may get the pre-treatments and transplant he desperately needs,' she wrote on the fundraising page. Scroll down for video . Plea: Sammy Griner is pictured with his 39-year-old father, Justin, who needs a kidney transplant . Famous face: Sammy is better known as the face of the 'Success Kid' meme. His mother snapped the photo - which actually shows him just moments before trying to put sand in his mouth - when he was 11 months . 'His mother died from this disease, please help us write a different story for Justin and his son, Sam.' By Tuesday afternoon, the page had raised more than $38,000 of the goal. Although Griner initially decided against using the notoriety of 'Success Kid' to help raise funds, she eventually spoke to The Daily Dot about the campaign because of her fears for her husband. Justin, 39, discovered his kidneys were failing before the birth of their son and he now spends about four hours a day, three days a week undergoing dialysis, Mrs Griner told ABC News. He is unable to work and never has energy, she said. The longer he is on the dialysis, the higher the chance that he could develop complications. 'Six years on dialysis is getting to be a long time,' she said. 'It's wearing on him.' Sign of success: His face has since been used to create the internet's most positive meme, pictured . Grimace: An image shows Sammy, who is now eight years old, posing beside a t-shirt bearing his face . The funds will supplement the money Medicare puts towards the procedure. The family will also need $12,000 for just the first year of medications, although he'll be on drugs for the rest of his life. It is also not yet clear where the kidney will come from and so the family is also using the GoFundMe page to ask strangers to see if they could be a match. So far, no friends or family members have proved a match, she told The Daily Dot, and getting on a list for a deceased donor can take at least five years. 'We certainly prefer a living donor because the prognosis seems to be much better,' she said. 'We're certainly not opposed [to waiting for a donor], but obviously, the sooner the better for us all.' To help raise awareness about her husband's need for a kidney, she turned to her son for help. Mrs Griner had snapped the photo of Sammy on the beach when he was 11 months old. The image looks as if he is punching the air - but she said he was actually about to put sand in his mouth. Close: Justin, pictured, discovered his kidneys were failing before Sam was born and receives dialysis . Appeal: The boy's mother, Laney, said she initially didn't want to use the boy's famous face to raise funds because she wanted the focus to be on Justin, but she said she just wants to see him healthy . She put the photo on her Flickr page in 2007 and two years later, she noticed that it was being used for memes before eventually becoming the beloved 'Success Kid' meme around 2010. His face has featured on billboard, TV commercials and t-shirts, which Mrs Griner called both 'weird' and 'awesome'. 'By now, it's just out there,' she said. 'What am I going to do? At least it's positive. Without that happening, how much could I get this recognition about my husband's kidney transplant?' There are more than 100,000 people waiting for a kidney transplant in the U.S., and of the 29,531 kidney transplants carried out last year, 23,715 were from living donors, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network."

Claudetteia Love, 17, said last week that she and her friends would not go to Carroll High School's prom in Monroe, Louisiana, because Principal Patrick Taylor had told her she had to wear a dress. Her comments sparked an outpouring of support from across the country - from her classmates, who signed a petition to persuade the school to change its mind, to gay rights groups and strangers. But now, Principal Taylor and Monroe City School Board President Rodney McFarland - who had backed Claudetteia - have reportedly told the student that she can wear a tux to the prom after all. Result! Claudetteia Love (pictured), 17, was told by her school principal that she was not allowed to wear a tuxedo to her senior prom. However, she has now been informed that she may wear the attire after all . On Tuesday, the National Center for Lesbian Rights said in a news release that the pair had contacted the teenager to inform her of their decision relating to the event on April 24. In the release, Claudetteia, who is openly gay, said she had been inspired by the countless supportive comments and offers she has received in the wake of her controversial tuxedo ban. The support included a local businessman's offer to create a prom for her and her friends, and a letter sent to school superintendents in the state by the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. “The outpouring of support has been incredible and inspiring; it is a source of strength that I will keep with me as I move on the next phase of my education and life beyond high school,' said Claudetteia. She added she was 'thankful' for the school's latest decision. 'I am looking forward to celebrating the end of my senior year with my friends and classmates at the prom, like any other student,' she said. Last week, Claudetteia's mother, Geraldine Jackson, who is 'fully supportive' of her daughter's gay identity, said Principal Taylor had told her staff would not supervise the prom if girls wore tuxes. Principal: Claudetteia said last week that she and her friends would not go to Carroll High School's prom in Monroe, Louisiana, because Principal Patrick Taylor (pictured) had told her she had to wear a dress . Release: But now, Principal Taylor and school board president Rodney McFarland have told the student she can wear a tux to the prom, according to a news release (pictured) by the National Center for Lesbian Rights . 'That's his exact words. ""Girls wear dresses and boys wear tuxes, and that's the way it is"",' she told The News-Star, adding that staff members had not acted on the petition started by students. Meanwhile, Claudetteia told the newspaper: 'I told my mom, ""They're using me"". They put me in all these honors and advanced placement classes so I can take all of these tests and get good grades and better the school, but when it's time for me to celebrate the fact that I've accomplished what I need to accomplish and I'm about to graduate, they don't want to let me do it the way I want to.' She added: 'There are people in the world that won't accept you but they don't have to be so judgmental and make you feel like you're less of a person and that you shouldn't express yourself.' Ms Jackson and Claudetteia are both now 'very happy' after Caroll High School reversed its ban. Inspired: In the release, Claudetteia (left and right), who is openly gay, said she had been inspired by the countless supportive comments and offers she has received in the wake of her controversial tuxedo ban . Last week, Principal Taylor told the News-Star that the earlier decision was part of the school's dress code and not anything personal. However, Claudetteia and her family said they did not believe it. McFarland told the paper that Principal Taylor's stance was not backed up by board policy. 'Banning her from her prom just because of what she wants to wear - that's discrimination,' he said. 'As far as I know there is no Monroe City School Board policy saying what someone has to wear to attend the prom. You can't just go making up policies.' McFarland said he planned to ask Superintendent Brent Vidrine to talk to Principal Taylor. School: Claudetteia is a top-performing student at Carroll High School (pictured) She will represent the school at an annual scholars' banquet and has a full scholarship to Jackson State University once she graduates . In Tuesday's release, NCLR Executive Director Kate Kendell said: 'We are pleased to hear Principal Taylor and the Monroe City School Board corrected this wrong before any serious harm was done. 'Forbidding girls from wearing a tuxedo to the prom would have served no purpose other than to reinforce the worst sorts of harmful stereotypes and censor a core part of Claudetteia’s identity.' Last year, Claudetteia was one of a group of students presented in a Monroe City School Board meeting as part of the school's high achieving medical magnet program. She will represent the school at the annual Scholars' Banquet, an event for the top students in Ouachita Parish, and has a full scholarship to Jackson State University. Neither Principal Taylor nor McFarland immediately returned calls for comment from AP."

In August, Lachaux and Phillips decided to go on a road trip in California for over six months. They rented a vehicle which did not have enough space for all the family, so they left the teen and her three-year-old sister behind. Police said the pair left the teen, who can not be named, with food and medication for the three-year-old who had breathing problems. But while they were away, the teen gave birth in her mom's bed - she did not have any medical help and did not take the newborn to the hospital. The arrest report states she told police her mother was not aware that she was raped or pregnant. The teen ran out of food and began to suffer from malnutrition along with her baby and her three-year-old sister. She stopped breastfeeding after two months because she was so undernourished and switched to baby formula. It was during this period that the three-year-old died - the cause of the death is under investigation. The teen was left alone at the home in Las Vegas (pictured).

She told them that when she told her stepfather that the body smelt, he allegedly told her to put her little sister in a box. She wrapped the toddler in a pink blanket and put her inside a cardboard box designed to hold a stroller. When he returned on March 28, they moved the box inside a broken car in the garage and then piled pizza boxes on top. Lachaux was allegedly desperate to hide the baby's birth from his wife before she returned and gave the teen some baby formula before kicking her and the baby out from the home . She went to a supermarket and wandered around for a few hours before walking four miles to McCarran International Airport. She spent the night there with the infant and the next day Lachaux used a fake name to book his stepdaughter a room at a motel near there - she was now only feeding the baby water because the formula had run out.

Lachaux faces three counts of child abuse with substantial bodily harm or death, and one count of destroying or concealing evidence - bail is set at $1 million. Phillips who turned herself in after a police search, faces two counts of child abuse with substantial bodily harm or death. Her five children, aged between one and nine, are now in Child Protective Services. The 17-year-old faces one count of child abuse with substantial bodily harm or death and one count of destroying or concealing evidence.

Or should she be punished for her actions?'"

Wendell Steiner, his wife, and their four children were stopped by police in Akron, Ohio during their 300-mile journey from Nova, Ohio to Pennsylvania. Although Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts and not the Buckeye State, the former presidential candidate famously came under fire during his 2012 run for the White House after it was revealed he once drove for 12 hours with his Irish Setter Seamus on top of his car in a carrier.

Wendell Steiner, his wife, and their four children were stopped by police in Akron, Ohio during their 300-mile journey from Nova, Ohio to Pennsylvania . Mitt Romney (left)  came under fire when it was revealed he once drove for 12 hours with his dog on his car . Steiner's mixed-breed puppies were wind-battered and huddled together in the cage when they were rescued, but had no injuries, according to Sgt. Kris Beitzel. 'I didn't see any injuries. They would not leave each other,' she told WKYC. 'They had urinated all over the inside of the cage. When I tried to get them out, they were trying to crawl back in.' The cage was covered on three sides with a blanket but its rear was left exposed. Beitzel said that when she asked the father why the dogs were not riding in the car as well, he responded that there wasn't room because he had 'far more important things to put in the car, meaning his children'. Steiner told police the puppies belong to his father, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. He said they were transporting the dogs to his wife's family in Pennsylvania because his father could no longer keep them. Akron Police Sgt Kris Beitzel (left) tended to the four dogs in the cage while the two sisters closely kept watch . Beitzel said the Mennonite family 'had no idea what they were doing was wrong'. 'They couldn't understand what all the tension was about,' she told Buzzfeed. 'In that culture they just look at puppies as livestock. They don't look at them as pets the way we do.' The family, who said they had no idea it was illegal to transport animals on top of a moving vehicle, were let go with a warning. 'If I had known, I'd never agree to it,' Steiner told the Akon Beacon Journal. 'I would have kept them in Nova.' The family handed the puppies over to the police, and Beitzel said she believes the 'traumatized' puppies will come around 'with a little love and attention'.

The puppies were taken to a local veterinarian hospital to be examined and will be placed with the Human Society of Great Akron to be put up for adoption. Romney's revelation about his 1983 vacation was an issue during his 2008 presidential campaign as well, but it was a much bigger issue for him in 2012. During the lead up to the election, a Dogs Against Romney Facebook group was created, 'Dogs Aren't Luggage' T-shirts were sold and Romney was lampooned by late-night hosts about the story on a nightly basis. Democratic strategist Chris Lehane told the Washington Post in 2012: '“It’s a signifier. 'There are certain events that happen over the course of someone’s life that play into a larger story line and feed into a caricature. 'Seamus the dog story just plays into a negative story line about a guy who you may not completely trust.” Akron police didn't charge Steiner, but they did educate him about the proper transportation of animals .

But perhaps the most disturbing part of the video is when, while Destiny is on the ground, her skirt rides up and men proceed to laugh and take pictures, one even exclaiming 'somebody smack that!' Destiny said she was play fighting with her friend at the park on a nice day during spring break last Monday before the riot broke out. She said people saw her and her friend and got the wrong idea. They came back with a crowd of people who, she said, were looking for a fight. When Lajahia tried to step in and help Destiny, all hell broke loose. 'It just escalated from there,' Destiny told NJ.com. 'Just like a riot broke out, they just started hitting us.' Destiny said she called her mother and asked her to pick the girls, telling her there were 'grown women' walking up to the sisters. That's when then the 16-year-old first got hit, causing her to drop her phone. 'I just had to defend myself,' she told MY 9 NJ. The girls said they saw multiple police cars at the park as they left. Destiny said no one got out to offer the girls any help, even as Destiny's nose was bleeding. Destiny (pictured) has been left with a bald spot after people pulled on her hair throughout the fight . Lajahia said one girl ripped an earring out of her ear, and then the girl's mother threw a rock at her ear, leaving a gash that required 12 stitches . 'They just stayed in their cars and just looked at us,' Destiny said. 'I just felt like we were out there by ourselves and there were people stomping us on our head,' she told NJ.com. 'Nobody was out there trying to help us - nobody.' According to police spokesman Lt. Stephen Varn, patrol officers received a 911 call for a reported street fight. Two patrol units arrived at the scene of the brawl and reported that no other police officers were needed. Trenton Mayor Eric Jackson released a statement saying he was angered 'by the lack of good Samaritans who should have stepped forward to come to the aid of these victims'. A park ranger has since been installed to monitor Greg Grant Park. Police Captain Eddie Gonzalez called the video 'sickening' and said the department had identified 'a number of individuals that were a part of this'. 'We will take swift action with them very, very shortly,' he said. 'Warrants will be issued in the very near future.' Destiny said police just 'stayed in their cars' and stared as she and her sister Lajahia (pictured) left the park after being brutally beaten ."
103a9ab47e8f90f42f92462986136bb0f377f0c7,"A Michigan girl dismissed from a Catholic school for not meeting academic and attendance standards during leukemia treatments has been invited back but will attend a public school for now, her mother said. Barbara McGrath said St. Joseph Middle School officials informed her that Rose McGrath could return to the Battle Creek school but postponed a meeting to discuss concerns until later this week to allow for 'a cooling-off period.' Barbara McGrath said that her daughter is attending Lakeview Middle School and that she can't say whether Rose will return to St. Joseph, a private Catholic school, until she determines if issues can be resolved. Rose McGrath, pictured here with her mother, Barbara McGrath, was dismissed from St Joseph Middle School in Battle Creek, Michigan, for not meeting academic and attendance standards. She's been battling leukemia since 2012 and has missed several days of school because of the recovery process . When Rose found out that she had been kicked out of the school, she tearfully said that she 'didn't do anything wrong'. The 7th-grader is in remission but still recovering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatments, which started in 2012 . 'It sounds like they're not going to pass her anyway, even if she goes back,' Barbara McGrath said of her 7th-grade daughter, who is in remission but still recovering from treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed in 2012. 'I don't see her being able to go back there and being successful.' The school wrote in a letter addressed to Rose's father that officials worked with her but absences 'hampered her academic performance.' It adds that the 12-year-old had attended 32 full days this academic year out of 134 days as of April 13, but Barbara McGrath says that doesn't include 'numerous' partial days. The school, which charges as much as $6,983 per year for tuition, also wrote that it has taken 'significant adjustments to our standards' to help Rose, including reducing her workload and paring down assignments and tests. 'Rose's attendance, coupled with her academic performance, do not qualify her for continued attendance at St. Joseph Middle School,' the letter read. It continued: 'We know Rose to be an intelligent and thoughtful child, and believe she would be well-suited to enroll in an academic setting more geared to homebound students, perhaps an online program as we have discussed in the past.' Though Rose is done with her treatment she still feels ill and has trouble attending her classes and finishing her schoolwork . Rose's mother says her daughter isn't skipping out of school 'to have fun' but that she has to miss school because she doesn't feel well . Battle Creek Area Catholic Schools' pastor administrator John Fleckenstein was not immediately available for a comment. He told WWMT last week that 'these were extraordinary circumstances' but they were necessary after 'so many accommodations were made' to help Rose. Barbara McGrath countered that the school made only minor modifications to the workload and her daughter 'had to do every single project, every single test.' McGrath added that, by her account, Rose was on track to pass this year. 'I didn't do anything wrong, but they still got rid of me,' Rose McGrath said tearfully last week to WWMT. Barbara McGrath said that though Rose is finished with her treatments, she has a long way to go. John Fleckenstein, Battle Creek Area Catholic Schools' pastor administrator, claims that the school made many accommodations for Rose and that none of them seemed to help her enough . Rose attended St Joseph Middle School in Battle Creek from kindergarten through 7th grade. Though she's been offered a spot back at the school after they dismissed her, Rose's mother said 'it sounds like they're not going to pass her anyway, even if she goes back' 'Even though she's now done with her treatments you still have a very long recovery process because you've basically just put two and a half years of poison into your body. You're not recovering overnight,' she said.. Rose told WWMT that school was the one place that she actually felt normal. 'When I'm at home, I'm sick, I don't feel well; no one else does that. But when I'm at school I'm like everyone else,' Rose said. ''The accommodations which were made were woefully inadequate for a child with such a serious diagnosis,' said Rose's father Tom McGrath to WWMT. 'It's not like she's out at the mall having fun, she's in her bed, sick with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. She's not having fun, she's sick. She'd be at school if she could,' Barbara said. Barbara McGrath said they have filed a complaint with the federal Office of Civil Rights and asked the private district to adopt an accommodation plan for ill students similar to those required in public schools. Rose appears to have had a large support system throughout her treatment. She told one news source that school was the only place she felt normal . St Joseph claims that Rose, pictured here raising money for St. Baldrcks to find a cure for childhood cancer, only attended 32 full days this academic year out of 134 days as of April 13. Though St Joseph as invited her back, she is now attending a public middle school in the Battle Creek area ."
21030573ff6bfdee513380f10df25af64cf66a17,"Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless. The Pacman laughed with trainer Freddie Roach on Monday after Shapiro, most famed for representing OJ Simpson in 1995, gave him a custom-made speed ball with Mayweather's face painted on it. Pacquiao's speed and work rate are expected to be his biggest weapon against Mayweather when they take the ring in less than three weeks at the MGM Grand Garden Area in Las Vegas. Manny Pacquiao inspects a speed ball with the face of Floyd Mayweather painted on it during a break from training on Tuesday . Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) laugh at the gift given by celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro (centre in the white hat) Robert Leslie Shapiro, 72, is a civil litigator working out of Los Angeles-based firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro. Most famously, Shapiro was an integral member of OJ Simpson's 1995 defense team when the former NFL player successfully fought charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman in 1994. Other star clients include baseballers Darryl Strawberry, José Canseco and Vince Coleman, along with Johnny Carson, the Kardashians, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Linda Lovelace. In the US, he also appears in TV commercials for LegalZoom, a company he co-founded. Pacquiao is the underdog for the bout, billed as The Biggest Fight In History and tipped to gross more than £300m, but you wouldn't know it from his quiet  confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with Roach at his Los Angeles base. While sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum, Pacman looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on Tuesday at the Wild Card Boxing gym, just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood. For victory the eight-division world champion must do what no-one has done in Mayweather's 47-fight career and inflict defeat on the Money Man from Michigan, a five-division world champion in his own right and, of course, the holder of the welterweight titles they'll be fighting for.

There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight. Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout. 'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'"

The Filipino has been involved in some of the biggest bouts in the world over the past decade or so, facing the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and four fights against Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez. But it's been a tough road to the top for Pacquiao from being born into poverty in the Philippines. He spent the early part of his career boxing in the Far East before being given his chance on the big stage in 2001 against Lehlo Ledwaba in an IBF world super-bantamweight title fight in Las Vegas.

Ever since dethroning the South African world champion on that June night at the MGM Grand 14 years ago, Pacquiao hasn't looked back and is set to take on Mayweather in the Fight of the Century on Saturday. Just days away from the $300million showdown on the Vegas Strip, pictures have emerged of Pacquiao as a teenager in a Manila boxing gym, when occasions such as this Saturday night were just a dream. Pacquiao moved away from home a the age of 14 to the country's capital Manila to pursue his boxing career and the rest, as they say, is history. The 36-year-old is now one of the biggest stars in the world. These incredible pictures show Pacquiao training at the LM Gym in Manila in 1996 at the age of 17 after he won his first 10 professional bouts - all of which were in 1995. In the same year that these pictures were taken, Mayweather was preparing to box at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, which ended for him in a controversial loss  against Serafim Todorov in the semi-finals. Nineteen years later, Mayweather and Pacquiao will finally cross paths in the biggest fight of this generation. The pair will make their first public appearances of the week on Tuesday as the bout draws ever closer. Boxing fans have already begun pouring into Las Vegas to taste the atmosphere building around the richest fight in history, even though only 500 tickets for the clash were made available for general sale. Pacquiao will host a fans' rally on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Hotel with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and his pet Jack Russell Pacman also present. Attention then turns to the MGM Grand, the venue for the fight on Saturday and where Mayweather will be making his grand arrival. The welterweight rivals were both due to attend the traditional grand arrival that marks the beginning of fight week only for Arum to withdraw Pacquiao, claiming the event is a 'waste of time'. Arum also pulled the plug on a media conference call with Pacquiao last week before a question had been asked, while Mayweather spoke for almost half an hour the following night. The one upmanship is sure to continue until fight day. Pacquiao has been involved in some of the biggest fights over the last decade but Saturday's occasion will eclipse all of them .

Great fast bowler Ambrose never spoke to the media during his playing career but launched his aptly titled autobiography Time to Talk on the eve of the West Indies-England series. Ambrose was one of the West Indies stars, along with Sir Viv Richards and Richie Richardson, who accompanied Stanford when he flew by helicopter to the Lord's nursery ground in 2008 to launch his five-year deal with England that ended with his arrest and subsequent 110-year jail sentence, just one $20million T20 game into the contract.

Michael Vaughan might still be a long way from agreeing terms and working patterns to become England's director of cricket.

Authorities said in a news release Thursday that 49-year-old Thomas K. Jenkins of Capitol Heights, Maryland, was arrested last month by deputies with the Prince George's County Sheriff's Office. 'Rat burglar': Thomas K. Jenkins, pictured is accused of robbing 18 Dover businesses . From September 2014 to February 2015, Jenkins allegedly carried out 18 commercial robberies in Dover, Delaware, authorities there said. 'During the investigation it was learned that the Prince George’s County Sheriff’s Department had a series of burglaries that were similar in nature to the eighteen committed in Dover,' the release said. Thomas Jenkins has been accused by the Dover Police Department of robbing multiple businesses. They are: . Maple Dale Country Club . Manlove Auto Parts . Sovereign Properties . Morgan Properties . U and I Builders . AMCO Check Cashing . Colonial Investment . 1st Capital Mortgage . Advantage Travel . Ancient Way Massage . Tranquil Spirit Massage/Spa . Christopher  Asay Massage . Morgan Communities . Vincenzo's Restaurant . Happy Fortune Chinese Restaurant . Happy 13 Liquors . Del-One Credit Union . Pizza Time . Melvin's Auto Service . Source: Dover Police Department/The News Journal . A car was found behind a building where a robbery took place and led  deputies in Maryland to consider Jenkins as a suspect, authorities said. Law enforcement later found Jenkin's car and tracked where he went, Dover police said. Police say Jenkins had cut a hole in the roof of a commercial business in Maryland on March 9 and deputies arrested him as he fled. According to Dover police, 'Jenkins was found in possession of .45-caliber handgun that was stolen from a business in Delaware State Police Troop 9 jurisdiction. A search of Jenkins vehicle revealed an additional .45-caliber handgun stolen from the same business.' Jenkins is being held in Maryland and will face 72 charges involving the 18 burglaries in Dover when he is returned to Delaware. The charges he is facing break down to: four counts of wearing a disguise during the commission of a felony, eighteen counts of third-degree burglary, eighteen counts of possession of burglary tools, fourteen counts of theft under $1,500, and eighteen counts of criminal mischief, two of which are felonies, authorities said. Cpl. Mark Hoffman with the Dover Police Department told the News Journal that Delaware State Police are planning to file charges over a 19th robbery at Melvin's Auto Service, which reportedly occurred in a part of Dover where jurisdiction is held by state police. Sharon Hutchison, who works at one of the businesses Jenkins allegedly robbed, told the newspaper 'He cut through two layers of drywall, studs and insulation.' The Prince George's County Sheriff's Department did not immediately return a request for information on what charges Jenkins is facing there."
baf66b1e3037de6abb57fb8611a98a5b78ee6f5d,"The Ohio parents of a two-year-old child who authorities say was beaten and starved to death were indicted on aggravated murder charges Wednesday. Hamilton County's prosecutor said that the grand jury also indicted Andrea Bradley, 28, and Glen Bates, 32, on murder and child endangering charges in Glenara Bates' death. Prosecutor Joe Deters says the parents, both of Cincinnati, could face the death penalty if convicted of all the charges. Scroll down for video . Facing charges: Andrea Bradley (left), 28, and Glen Bates (right), 32, have been indicted on aggravated murder charges in the beating death of their 2-year-old daughter last month . Innocent: Glenara Bates was brought to an Ohio hospital last month dead and weighing only 13lbs . Deters' statement says Bradley took her baby daughter to a hospital March 29 where the girl was pronounced dead. The child had been badly beaten and had bruises, belt marks and bite marks, he said. The child also had injury to her head and broken teeth, and injuries had been inflicted over an extended period of time. She had over 100 wounds to her body total. According to the prosecutors, at the time of her death Glenara weighted only 13lbs - the average weight of a 3 or 4-month-old infant. Hamilton County Coroner Lakshmi Kode Sammarco, who performed the autopsy on Glenara, described it as the worst case of starvation she's ever witnessed in her career. 'There is no doubt in my mind this child was tortured for the majority of her pitifully short life,' Sammarco said. She recalled that it took a team of pathologists more than four hours to document all of the toddler's numerous injuries and scars. ‘The abuse this baby suffered is beyond belief,’ Deters said. 'If they [parents] get executed, God bless them, I’d like to see it.' The prosecutor said Bradley had seven children and is expecting her eighth child in July. Five of the other children — ages 1, 4, 5, 7 and 8 — were living with Bradley. Glenara had been taken away from the family after being diagnosed with malnutrition, but child services returned the girl to the mother just weeks before her death. Deters said that in her final days, the toddler ate and slept in a bathtub filled with feces and blood. 'You wouldn't treat your dog like this,' he said, . The parents are now in the custody of the Hamilton County Department of Job and Family Services. None of the other children showed current signs of abuse, Deters said. Matriarch: Bradley had seven children and is expecting her eighth child in July. This image from last July shows the woman pregnant with her youngest child and holding what appears to be a cigarette . Five of Bradley's seven children — ages 1, 4, 5, 7 and 8 — were living with the woman at the time of Glenara's death . He said an older child lives with paternal relatives. The indictments come on the same day that child-welfare workers across Ohio are promoting awareness and prevention of child abuse and in the wake of a high-profile Cincinnati case involving a 3-month-old infant's decapitation. That child's mother, Deasia Watkins, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of aggravated murder. Last week, Bradley’s sister, Desana Townsend, told the station WCPO that the 28-year-old mother of eight tortured her daughter. Investigators say Glenara's parents dropped her from 6 feet above ground, and her mother then tried to sew her head wound at home with a needle and thread. Calling her sibling 'heartless,' Ms Townsend said Bradley did not deserve to have children. Detective Eric Karaguless said during a preliminary hearing that the couple admitted to the abuse, which lasted more than three weeks. Investigators say Glenara's parents dropped her from 6 feet about ground, and her mother then tried to close up her head wound at home with a needle and thread . Bradley allegedly told detectives during questioning that she had whipped the toddler with a belt and failed to seek medical help for her after Glenara was dropped on her head. The mother of eight has a history of child abuse dating back to 2007, according to documents. On Wednesday, Job and Family Services Director Moira Weir publicly acknowledged that her agency mishandled Glenara's case. 'We cannot comment publicly on the specifics of this case, but I will say a preliminary review shows we failed to follow our own policies and procedures in this case,' she stated."

Police remain hopeful they will find the boy who went missing from the campsite on Friday. An increased number of police and other emergency crews continue to scour the thick bushland areas around Lake Eildon. On Sunday, search co-ordinator Acting Senior Sergeant Andrew Walker said Luke had a 'very high pain tolerance', a factor that would work in his favour given he has now been missing for days. 'Hence the reason why we’re out searching. We’re still hopeful that we can find him,' Sgt Walker said. The 11-year-old, who is autistic, was reportedly seen walking near the Devils River on Sunday, four kilometres south of his campsite where he was last seen. Search crews have rushed to the location and police remain comfortable that the young boy is still alive. A Victorian Police spokeswoman told AAP late on Sunday a family saw a young boy matching Luke's description while they were driving in the Devils River vicinity.

'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush, we've got a lot searchers searching all the tracks and in between the tracks and the gullies and the spurs,' he told reporters on Saturday. The Shambrook family has thanked emergency service workers, volunteers, family and friends for their help. They say the disappearance is completely out of character for him. Luke is described as being of medium build, about 150 cm tall with olive skin, brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a black windcheater, black t-shirt, grey track-pants, grey boots and a scarf."

Stoll, 32, is the longtime boyfriend of Dancing With The Stars host Erin Andrews, a former ESPN employee who now works as an NFL sideline reporter for Fox Sports. The NHL player was arrested for possession of cocaine and MDMA, also known as Molly, at the Wet Republic pool at the MGM Grand Hotel shortly before 5pm. On Monday TMZ Sports added that the athlete was trying to smuggle over three grams of cocaine and over eight grams of MDMA by hiding them in his board shorts. Scroll down for video . Jarret Stoll, 32 (left), is the longtime boyfriend of Dancing With The Stars host Erin Andrews, 36 (right) He looked bright-eyed and alert in a mugshot taken Friday evening in Las Vegas . Stoll (seen partying at the MGM Grand in 2014 after the Kings Stanley Cup win) was arrested on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada, on drug possession charges . He was arrested for possession of cocaine at the Wet Republic pool at the MGM Grand (above) Stoll was previously in the news for non-sports related reasons back in 2013 when he was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure at his home in Hermosa Beach, California during the offseason, with the Kings later saying they did not know what caused the incident. Stoll, who will make a cameo in the upcoming film version of the popular HBO show Entourage, was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and was listed as having a hearing on Saturday after posting $5,000 bail. The charges include possession of Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy. Michael Pariente, a Las Vegas criminal defense lawyer, says that Stoll will likely be offered a plea deal as a first time offender. Speaking with TSN, he said; 'It's pretty much a slap on the wrist. Even if he was going to represent himself they'd make him an offer like this.' This would include a $1,000 fee, an online drug awareness course, and possibly community service. Stoll was likely at the MGM Grand to attend the two year anniversary of their popular club Hakkasan Friday evening, an event that featured Tiesto and brought out Christina Aguilera. In both 2012 and 2014, Stoll headed to the MGM Grand to celebrate  the end of the hockey season with his Kings teammates. It seems that Stoll went on a date with Andrews on Thursday night, as she posted a photo of a romantic-looking candle that was seemingly taken at Italian restaurant La Sosta Enoteca in Manhattan Beach, California, on her Instagram page, and a fan snapped a photo with Stoll earlier in the day in the same neighborhood. The caption, which did not mention Stoll by name, read: 'Always a great date night'. Andrews posted a photo of a candle that was seemingly taken at Italian restaurant La Sosta Enoteca in Manhattan Beach, California, on her Instagram page on Thursday. That location is four hours from Vegas . Andrews sparked engagement rumors after she posted an Instagram of her wearing a large ring in March . A fan snapped this photo with Stoll on Thursday in California . Stoll had 17 points in 73 games this season and was a member of the Kings' Stanley Cup championship teams in 2012 and 2014. He has been with the team since 2008, but will become an unrestricted free agent on July 1. The Kings failed to qualify for postseason play after winning the Stanley Cup last year and in 2012. The team said in a statement following Stoll's arrest: 'We are aware of police reports out of Clark County, Nevada regarding Jarret Stoll. 'Our organization is concerned and has begun conducting a thorough internal investigation. 'While we continue to actively gather facts, we are withholding further comment at this time.' Veteran had 17 points in 73 games this season and was a member of the Kings' recent Stanley Cup teams . Andrews, 36, sparked engagement rumors after she posted an Instagram of her wearing a very large, square-cut diamond ring last month. Fans thought the picture meant Stoll had proposed, but Andrews said the ring was on loan. 'I've definitely dropped hints here and there,' the Fox broadcaster shared with ABC News in July. 'But we haven't looked at rings... Nothing there yet, the ball's in his court.' She added: 'But no we are fine! We've had enough on our plate for the last two years of dating and haven't really gone there yet.' He was previously engaged to actress and model Rachel Hunter, the former wife of singer Rod Stewart, and dated actress Katie Cassidy. Stoll broke off his engagement with Hunter just seven weeks before they were supposed to be married."
d11ecbcc828403caa6d356def04c77b373de4459,"The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has denied that partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities. Countering President Barack Obama's previous assertion, Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal'. The 62-year-old politician continued: 'We just set in place a process to ensure that if there's a deal, it's a deal that will stand the test of time, that will keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.' Making an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Corker  said that Congressional scrutiny and approval of any nuclear agreement with Iran is essential to help make sure that the deal is not a bad one. Scroll down for video . Chairman: Senator Bob Corker (pictured), of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has denied partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities . He said that Congress has a responsibility to scour the details of a final plan - including any classified annexes - and ask the Obama administration hard questions about it, before finally voting on it. 'It's very important that Congress is in the middle of this, understanding, teasing out, asking those important questions,' Corker said. Negotiators announced a framework deal on Thursday. The deal is scheduled to be finalized by June 30. Meanwhile, the Committee is due to meet April 14 to consider Corker's legislation to ensure that Congress debates and signs off on any pact. The bill requires the president to transmit, within five days of reaching a final deal, the text of the full agreement, along with materials related to its implementation. With key elements still to be finalized, the framework agreement sealed by U.S.-led world powers describes a program for stunting Iran's capacity to produce nuclear weapons, while giving Tehran quick access to assets and markets now blocked by international sanctions. In defending the framework and a potential final pact, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities. Argument: Countering President Barack Obama's (pictured) previous assertion, Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, told Fox News Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal' These will allow the U.S. and its partner negotiators to know almost instantly should Iran try to evade the oversight, Moniz said during an appearance on CBS' 'Face The Nation. This is a long-term arrangement, he stressed, with requirements lasting a quarter century or more. 'We'll have eyes on the entire supply chain of uranium,' he added on the program. 'Going back to mines, the mills, we'll have continuous surveillance of centrifuge production.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the framework as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. He is urging negotiators to improve the agreement or scuttle it. Other Republicans have echoed Netanyahu's concerns. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Sunday the proposed deal is a bad one - but was the best one Obama could get because the Iranians don't fear or respect him. Response: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) has criticized the framework deal as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. But in defending the framework, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz (right) cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities . He said that he favors waiting until a new president, Democratic or Republican, takes office in January 2017 and then trying again. In the meantime, economic and financial sanctions would stay in place. 'Is there a better deal to be had? I think so,' Graham said on CBS' 'Face The Nation.' But a senior Senate Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, warned that bashing the proposed deal could backfire on Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister and other critics of the framework agreement have offered no viable alternatives, she said on CNN's 'State of the Union.' Feinstein said imposing more and stiffer economic sanctions would only drive Iran's nuclear program deeper underground and make it more difficult to monitor. 'I wish he would contain himself,' Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said of Netanyahu. Officials (L-r) European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat, and an unidentified Russian official, look on as British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond shakes hands with Secretary of State John Kerry in Switzerland . The preliminary deal,  announced in Switzerland on Thursday, sees Iran agree to not build any new centrifuges for 15 years, and not enrich uranium at the previously secret Fordow site for 15 years. The country also agrees to reduce nuclear-material centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104, let the IAEA store all the extra centrifuges, give IAEA inspectors access to its uranium mills for 25 years and rebuild heavy-water reactor at Arak so it can't produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it would not build any new heavy-water reactors for 15 years. In return, the West will give Iran relief from nuclear-related economic sanctions 'if it verifiably abides by its commitments', and lift 'all past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue' as soon as Iran has completed all its promised 'nuclear-related actions'. America's sanctions on Iran relating to 'terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles' will remain in place."

Adriana Alvarez, 22, says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having worked for McDonald's for five years. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees of the fast food chain began to protest. Scroll down for video . Single mother Adriana Alvarez, 22, has revealed what it's really like to live on McDonald's wages, where she makes only $10.50 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement in Chicago . Alvarez (pictured with her three-year-old son Manny) says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having word for McDonald's for five years . The mother revealed in a column for Refinery29 that the first thing she would do with an increased wage would be to find a 'decent place to live' with good schools for her three-year-old son Manny. 'When it rains, water steeps into the apartment,' Alvarez writes of her basement home, the only place she said she can afford. 'This wetness brings mold, and I can't get rid of the smell. We can’t even leave anything on the floor... toys or anything else on the floor may get ruined when the water comes in.' Alvarez said that, after paying for 'child care, transportation to work, food, rent, and our other basic expenses,' she can never afford to give anything else to her son. 'Every time I think about taking Manny somewhere fun, like to a movie, I have to think about whether we can really afford the gas,' she writes. The mother said even providing the specific milk her son, who drinks 'a half-gallon every two days', requires because of his lactose intolerance can be a struggle. Since it's a more expensive brand, it uses up most of the $80 Alvarez is allotted in food stamps, she told the New York Times. Alvarez said her situation is not unique. She said that most of her co-workers are 'in the same boat', forced to rely on government assistance 'no matter how long they've held their jobs'. According to one study cited in Business Insider, half of the nation's fast food workers require some kind of government assistance, costing taxpayers $7billion a year. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees began protesting . Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand the $15 an hour wage . And $1.2billion of that public assistance goes to employees of McDonald's annually, reported a study released by the National Employment Law Project. Just weeks ago, McDonald's announced that it would be giving a $1 pay raise for about 90,000 employees, effectively making their wage $10 an hour. But the raise only applies to employees who work in restaurants owned by the corporation. Restaurants operated by independent franchise workers were ineligible for the wage bump, which Alvarez said disqualifies nine out of 10 McDonald's employees. And, even for those who do get an increased wage, Alvarez argues that the number would 'hardly going to lift any working family out of poverty'. And higher wages aren't all Alvarez and her co-workers are fighting for. She said Fight For $15 is also protesting for the ability to form a union 'without interference from management'. A group of protesters in New York stage a die-in as part of a day of rallies and protests by fast-food workers known as 'Fight for $15 on April 15' Fight For $15 (pictured protesting on Wednesday) started two years ago in New York, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving . Alvarez writes that she needs a union to help negotiate sick days, which she said she is currently not provided with, costing her a day's worth of wages when she has to stay home if her son is ill. Fight For $15 started two years ago in New York City, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving. The movement staged rallies across the country yesterday in honor of 'Fight for $15 on April 15'. Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand a wage raise. There has been some change. Seattle and San Francisco have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and a ballot campaign began in Washington, D.C. this week to initiate the same change. But Alvarez hope she will get to see change in her own life soon. 'It doesn't seem right that people who work with children or who serve food aren't paid enough to support their own kids or put food on their own table,' she writes. 'We want our families to be able to look forward to a better future.' There has been some change. Seattle and San Francisco have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and a ballot campaign began in Washington, D.C. this week to initiate the same change ."

Although she was adopted from India along with two of her siblings, it never occurred to her that she should explore her origins in India, where she was born before being adopted and starting a new life in the Lucky Country as an eight month old baby. But that all changed when she watched the movie Slumdog Millionaire and realised how profoundly different her life would have been if her new parents didn't take her in their arms and change her life forever. The film was nothing short of life-changing for Latika and led her to a fulfilling spiritual journey back to where it all began in an orphanage in the slums of India - the country she instantly fell in love with and has become her second home. Scroll down for video . Latika Bourke had no interest about looking into her origins until she watched the movie Slumdog Millionaire which she found life-changing . On her first visit to India she visited the orphanage before she was adopted and was shown the only record of her time there as a baby - Latika was very moved by the entry log with two photos of her as a baby . Latika - pictured with two nuns at the former orphanage - who kept the crib she was rocked in as a bundle of joy . 'I'm not exaggerating when I say it was one of the most profound moments of my life,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was the first time I really understood what could have happened if I hadn't been adopted. 'And the fact that the little girl in the movie had my name - I have never heard of anyone with my name before - it was really extraordinary.' It took Latika another three years to make it to India in 2012 and she has been every year since - admitting to being 'absolutely obsessed' with her mother country. 'I never had any sense of a part of me that was missing had been filled but I felt fuller as a person - I got that part of my story I had never known.' Latika's parents had two children then adopted her and Damian, from the same orphanage in Bihar, and their sister Rani from another part of India, and then had three another children of their own.

'It was a spiritual homecoming - by the end of the last couple of days that I stayed there I definitely felt like it was my home,' she said. The orphanage is now run as a centre to help the disadvantaged and educates young girls, but the nuns have kept a book with a handwritten record of the day she arrived and then when she was handed over to her adoptive parents. Although the details were very brief, along with with two back and white head shots, and don't provide any clues to where Latika had come from, she was over the moon. 'It's incredible that a few sentences and some ruled lines can mean anything but it did, it was just wow - a ""this is me"" moment - I cried happy tears,' she said. 'It was the first time I felt that connection had been forged because suddenly I was in this different country and there's me - my name in this book written 30 years ago it was amazing.'

She will feel eternally grateful to the nuns who cared for her as a defenceless tiny baby when nobody else could in the poverty-stricken state of Bihar. 'The nuns said they were sorry that they didn't have any more information but back then they were just so focused on trying to look after the babies and place them into loving homes - they just didn't think that these children would come back,' she said.

cd40588486d549aca706d99b41a2f1915ef05a24,"Attorneys for a 19-year-old accused of sexually assaulting several girls at his former high school say there is a 'treasure trove' of evidence proving the girls lied about the abuse, but the lawyers want further access to Facebook accounts to prove it. Tyler Kost, who appeared in court on Monday, was arrested last May for sexual crimes against 13 girls between 13 and 17 years old, most of whom were former classmates at Poston Butte High School. The Pinal County Attorney's Office says Kost faces 30 charges in three indictments ranging from sexual abuse to child molestation. Pictured: Tyler Kost has been in jail for over a year since a group of teenage girls accused him of sexual misdeeds . Accused: Attorneys for the 19-year-old accused of sexually assaulting several girls at his former high school say there is a 'treasure trove' of evidence proving the girls lied about the abuse . Kost stared straight ahead throughout most of the proceedings, his expression waffling between consternation and sedation. He looked older than in his booking photo with pale skin and close cropped brown hair. Kost's defense said new evidence taken from Facebook and Instagram proves the women lied about sexual abuse. 'Over a year ago Mr. Kost was publicly accused of being a serial rapist. What we know now is that there was a group of girls who conspired against Tyler to put him in jail. They succeeded in that, and Tyler has now been in jail for over a year based on those lies,' Kost attorney Christine Whalin told KSAZ. The prosecution handed over 98,000 pages of social media records from several of the alleged victims, but Defense Attorney Michael Alarid said he needs the communications of at least 8 other people to determine how far the plot spreads. The court documents reveal a group Facebook chat where three of the accusers and three witnesses made plans to 'teach a lesson' to Kost and referred to the movie 'John Tucker Must Die,' where ex-girlfriends take revenge on a former boyfriend. 'Tyler needs to be taught a lesson,' ran one interaction, reports KSAZ, as well as 'We should sacrifice him to Satan.' And another exchange read: . 'I'm down,'...'I already know this is going to be so much fun!' In court: The prosecution handed over 98,000 pages of social media records from several of the alleged victims, but Defense Attorney Michael Alarid said he needs the communications of at least 8 other people to determine how far the plot spreads . The exchange happened weeks before the women accused Kost of sexual assault. Facebook's privacy policy prevents the defense from gaining access to the other records, Alarid said. Only law enforcement can request the information from Facebook, he said. 'Quite frankly the fact that the state is refusing to get any additional social media records is concerning. It's shocking. Based on what we've uncovered so far they should be dismissing several charges. Instead they are digging their heels in and they are refusing to give us anything additional,' Alarid said. Prosecutor Shawn Jensvold said the records are not in the state's control and can't be turned over to the defense. Further, he said, the defense has not demonstrated a substantial need for the information. Taking cues? The court documents reveal a group Facebook chat where three of the accusers and three witnesses made plans to 'teach a lesson' to Kost and referred to the movie 'John Tucker Must Die,' where ex-girlfriends take revenge on a former boyfriend. The film stars Jesse Metcalfe and Ashanti . Jensvold said that the Facebook conversation only shows that three of the victims might be involved in a revenge plot, but not the other 10 victims. 'It's not the state's job to go on a fishing expedition for the defense, which is very clear within the case law,' he said. Kost was arrested after the Pinal County Sherriff's Office received a tip accusing him of sexual assault against five victims. He was booked on two counts of sexual assault and two counts of sexual misconduct with a minor. Detectives later identified eight other girls who said they were sexually abused by Kost. A spokesman for the sheriff's office said that in at least one case Kost threatened, harassed and told a victim to kill herself. In another, a victim said she became pregnant when she was raped after a Poston Butte homecoming dance. Judge Kevin White set the next hearing for May 4 at the Pinal County Superior Court. Back in court: Tyler Kost, who appeared in court on Monday, was arrested last May for sexual crimes against 13 girls between 13 and 17 years old. Kost stared straight ahead throughout most of the proceedings, his expression waffling between consternation and sedation.

fb5de836c6ec49c16a7b898cb52e5e773ed2fe79,"Elton John and lead singer of the band REM Michael Stipe have joined forces calling for the equal rights of transgender inmates in response to allegations of mistreatment at a Georgia prison. ‘Transgender women in male prisons have an equal right to protection from violence and abuse in prison, and yet they continue to face horrific injustices,’ according to a joint statement the musicians released Tuesday. Last week, the US Justice Department said prison officials must treat an inmate’s gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition following a February lawsuit from the Southern Poverty Law Center filed against Georgia Department of Corrections officials on behalf of Ashley Diamond, a transgender woman. Allies: Elton John and lead singer of REM Michael Stipe have joined forces calling for the equal rights of transgender inmates . Prison officials must treat an inmate's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition, according to a Justice Department ruling in the case of transgender inmate Ashley Diamond . According to the lawsuit, prison officials did not provide sufficient treatment for 36-year-old Diamond’s gender dysphoria - a condition that causes a person to experience extreme distress because of a disconnect between the birth sex and gender identity. The lawsuit also said Diamond was without hormone treatment for three years and her body suffered as a result, and that she had been sexually assaulted and ridiculed in prison. ‘More often than not, assaults in part go unreported because the perpetrators are prison guards, wardens and staff,’ said Stipe and John, who founded the Elton John AIDS Foundation. ‘This is outrageous, and the message it sends is horrific: that violence against and discrimination of trans people is not only allowed, but sanctioned.’ Both John, 68, and Stipe, 55, are openly gay. The frontman of REM is a long-time supporter of the Rocket Man singer’s foundation. In their statement, John and Stipe applauded the Justice Department for coming out in support of Ms Diamond and for challenging the constitutionality of Georgia’s policy of denying transgender inmates hormone treatments. But the musicians argued that more steps must be taken to end the ‘culture of violence and discrimination.’ ‘We urge the state of Georgia to embrace desperately needed changes to their correctional system,’ the statement concluded. Last week, a judge ordered California’s corrections department to provide a transgender inmate with sex-reassignment surgery. It was the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state. A photo of Diamond compared to her Department of Corrections mugshot shows the drastic difference without maintaining treatment . The Justice Department filed a brief in Ashley Diamon's case last Friday saying it's not taking a position on the accuracy of Diamond's claims, but reminding prison officials that the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution requires them to provide inmates with individualized assessment and care for the condition. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan wrote in an email that the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation. While similar cases have been brought in other courts, Justice Department officials said this is the first time the agency has gotten involved in one of these cases. That action signals this administration's commitment to protecting the interests of transgender people in this context and sends a message to state officials that the federal government has taken a clear position on the substantive legal issues in the case, said Georgia State University law professor Russell Covey. 'If Georgia disagrees, that sort of holds out the possibility of some future legal conflict between the state and the federal government,' he said. 'It's a kind of shot across the bow.' Diamond has identified as female since she was a child and began hormone therapy when she was 17, the Southern Poverty Law Center lawsuit says. Diamond says she has been subject to ridicule and even sexual assault while behind bars . That gave her full breasts, a feminine shape, softer skin and a feminine appearance. Only inmates identified as transgender during their initial intake screenings are eligible for gender dysphoria treatment under Georgia Department of Corrections policy, but the personnel who do those screenings often aren't familiar with the condition, the lawsuit says. Despite having noticeable feminine physical characteristics and telling department staff she was transgender and receiving hormone therapy, Diamond was not evaluated for gender dysphoria and wasn't referred for treatment and her hormone therapy was halted, the lawsuit says. Though medical personnel subsequently evaluated her and determined she had gender dysphoria and that hormone therapy and female gender expression were medically necessary, department officials refused to authorize the treatment, the lawsuit says. So-called freeze-frame policies, that only allow inmates the level of treatment that they received before imprisonment and that allow no treatment for those who weren't initially classified as suffering from gender dysphoria are unconstitutional, the Justice Department brief says. Such policies violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Without the hormone treatment for the past three years, Diamond's body has suffered a painful physical transformation back to its masculine state and she has experienced severe mental anguish, the lawsuit says. She has also been subject to ridicule by inmates and prison staff and has been sexually assaulted by inmates because she hasn't been offered safe accommodation, the lawsuit says. Diamond, 36, identifies as a female and has been on hormone therapy since she was 17 . Southern Poverty Law Center staff attorney Chinyere Ezie said in an emailed statement Friday that the Justice Department brief bolsters their arguments. 'Transgender inmates like Ashley have a right to proper medical care,' Ezie said. 'They have a right to protection from violence and abuse and these rights are secured by the U.S. Constitution.' Other courts have ordered hormones, psychotherapy and other treatments for transgender inmates. A federal judge on Thursday ordered California's corrections department to provide a transgender inmate with sex-reassignment surgery, the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state. It was only the second time anywhere in the country that a judge issued an injunction directing a state prison system to provide the surgery, said Ilona Turner, legal director at the Transgender Law Center in Oakland. The previous order in a Massachusetts case was overturned last year and is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court."
540c63f91feef5b273e9b5ae37af1a1b49fedd5e,"Rocker Richie Sambora is being investigated by police over claims he 'threatened to kill' his former fashion designer lover. The ex Bon Jovi guitarist, 55, allegedly told former business partner Nikki Lund he would 'dig a hole in the desert and bury her', Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. Sambora is said to have made the chilling threat during a blazing telephone argument on March 19. His shaken former flame decided to report the allegation to authorities a week later. Police in the wealthy Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a 'person of interest' in an active investigation into criminal threats. Scroll down for video . Everything was rosy between the ex Bon Jovi guitarist and his lover and business partner Nikki Lund last July. But Lund has claimed in a statement to police that Sambora recently threatened her saying he would 'dig a hole in the desert and bury her,' Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. The rock star is believed to be on vacation in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and daughter Ava but faces questioning when he returns. Lund, 33, founded the Nikki Rich clothing line with Sambora and confessed last year that the pair had been having an on-off personal relationship for eight years. When their affair ended it plunged the business partnership into turmoil, just as the duo were preparing to open a boutique on swank Robertson Boulevard. Sambora's alleged threat came just days after Lund launched her first signature solo show at the opening of LA fashion week on March 18. 'They are in the midst of unraveling their fashion business Nikki Rich,' a source told Daily Mail Online. 'Things have become very bitter in recent weeks. 'The threat happened in the midst of Nikki launching her solo line. Richie apparently went mad on the phone at her and threatened to kill her. 'He said words to the effect that he was going to dig a hole in the desert and bury her.' Nikki, a close childhood friend of Kim Kardashian, filed a report Wednesday night with detectives from the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station. Back to back: The couple posed for the cover of the new edition of  LA Fashion Magazine before they went their separate ways . 'She held off going to cops hoping that the situation would resolve itself,' added the source. But after advice from lawyers and business associates she made the report. 'Richie has been drinking heavily for months and acting erratically . 'He has threatened violence in the past.' Nikki and Kim K are friends from way back . Lieutenant Jennifer Seetoo confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a person of interest in the case. Under Californian law making criminal threats can be a felony offence punishable by up to four years in jail. 'A report was taken regarding criminal threats,' Lieutenant Seetoo said. 'It's an active investigation.' A representative of Mr. Sambora said there was no truth in Nikki Lund's claims. 'This is a cluster of fabricated lies in retaliation for Mr Sambora's decision to cease further funding of the unprofitable partnership, plain and simple,' said the rep. Sambora suddenly quit Bon Jovi during their 2013 world tour because of 'personal issues'. The New York Post later reported that Jon Bon Jovi had kicked out his longtime songwriting partner due to substance abuse issues. Sambora and Lund reportedly began their romance in 2006 - a year before his divorce from Dynasty actress Locklear was finalized. Denise Richards dated Sambora . Sambora is believed to be in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and their daughter Ava . They are said to have carried on seeing each other despite Sambora going on to date another Hollywood beauty, Denise Richards. The long-time fling became public last December when Lund was doing publicity for the new fashion line. The curvy blonde confessed to Playboy TV: 'He's amazing in bed ... how could you stay away from the guy?' Their joint venture collapsed at the last moment, however, despite the pair appearing on billboards together and on the cover of Los Angeles Fashion magazine. Sambora is now dating Australian guitarist Orianthi despite a 26-year age difference. Lund's attorney declined to comment on the complaint. Current squeeze: Sambora is now dating Australian guitarist Orianthi despite a 26-year age difference ."
85f48a4c6cada2c15879e964895198f6b42af456,"From solar-powered models of the Queen to a £1,200 Wedgwood bust of Prince Charles, there's no item of royal memorabilia too big or too small for royalist Margaret Tyler. The pensioner, 71, has been collecting royal-themed knick-knacks for more than 40 years and now boasts a collection worth £10,000. But squeezing it all into her small terraced home hasn't been easy and her gargantuan collection now fills four whole rooms, including one dedicated to Princess Diana alone. Scroll down for video . Passionate: Margaret Tyler, 71, has amassed a vast collection of royal memorabilia . Despite having a home that quite literally bursts with items, Mrs Tyler, a mother-of-four, says she has no plans to stop collecting and describes it as 'a labour of love'. 'There's loads of royal magazines that I read, so I get up at about 4.30am to keep up with it all,' she reveals. 'I'm retired but I don't think I've actually ever worked so hard in my life. It takes a lot of work [to maintain] but it's a labour of love.' As well as collecting royal memorabilia, Mrs Tyler, a retired charity worker, is also obsessed with meeting the real thing and says she spent six days outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital in London when Prince George was born. 'I was there for six days,' she beams. '[My son] Andrew was born at St. Mary's and I was only there for two days. 'I just wanted to feel close to them [William and Kate], I suppose. I spent the time meeting people, and chatting.I was convinced it was going to be a girl, but it wasn't.' Extensive: Her collection includes china, a solar powered Queen and thousands of photos . Got it! A copy of the Duchess of Cambridge's £450 Issa engagement dress is in the collection . Although Mrs Tyler, who considers the Royal Family and extension of her own, didn't shake hands with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on that occasion, she has met a number of senior royals, among them the Queen. 'I've met a lot of them,' she reveals. 'I've met the Queen, I've met Prince Andrew and Prince Charles so I've been very lucky.' But despite considering herself lucky to have met so many royals, it is collecting that is her real passion and she has amassed around 10,000 items over 40 years. These are stored in four rooms, each with a different royal theme. Her drawing room is devoted to the Queen, while another, known as the Sandringham Room, has been turned into a £75-a-night B&B for royal enthusiasts. Her front room contains items created for every royal event in the past century, among them the 1953 Coronation and the 2012 Diamond Jubilee, while another space, dubbed 'the Memorial Room' is devoted exclusively to Princess Diana. Meeting: Mrs Tyler has met several members of the Royal Family including the Queen and Prince Charles . Favourite: Princess DIana remains one of Mrs Tyler's favourite royals and has an entire room to her name . Homage: Mrs Tyler in her Princess Diana room. Her favourite painting is seen on the back wall (centre) Inside are some of her most prized possessions, among them a Diana handbag, a set of Diana-themed matrioshka dolls and a stained glass window that Mrs Tyler commissioned in 1998 - a year after the princess' death. The room also boasts a fresco of the late princess painted on the ceiling and a large oil painting of Diana with her sons William and Harry. 'I think that says it all about Diana,' she says of the painting. 'She was a mother first and foremost.' Nevertheless, items devoted to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall also occupy a considerable amount of the floor-space, as do the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. And while much of the collection might be made up of novelty items picked up at London markets, other items, such as a £450 Issa dress identical to the one worn by the Duchess of Cambridge for her engagement announcement, didn't come cheap. Despite the outlay and her rapidly diminishing space, Mrs Tyler says she will go on collecting royal memorabilia 'forever'. 'Enough is never enough,' she beams. 'It's an ongoing story isn't it? When William and Catherine's baby is born, it will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. 'It doesn't stop dead. You can't pretend that life isn't going on for them. Anyway, I just love it! Not even the dusting gets me down.'"

'As soon as I took that first step, it was as if all my worries and fears dissipated,' Ms Pitt said. 'I had finished the run but I also beat my time from before my injury.' The revelation follows after she successfully underwent reconstructive surgery to rebuild a nose but she was not expecting complications where she had stopped breathing during the procedure. When Ms Pitt woke up from her surgery, she expected to wake up in the burns unit with a brand new nose but  the moment she woke up in intensive care, she revealed she just wanted to die. 'At that point, all I wanted was death because I had worked so hard just to end up in the same situation,' Ms Pitt said. But she marked a new milestone in her recovery after another harrowing heath scare where her family feared the worst as she told Woman's Day: 'I can't believe I didn't have a nose for so long'.

In an interview with Women's Day last month, her mother, Celestine Vaite, said she and Turia's partner Michael Hoskin heard the hospital's cardiac arrest alarm go off 'and we thought she was gone' during the nose reconstruction. 'I said, God, don't you dare. She's fought so hard, this girl,' she told the magazine. 'She fought to get out of bed, she fought to walk, she fought to accept - don't you dare do that to her!' Ms Pitt wore a compression stocking for almost two years and had seven of her fingers amputated during a seemingly endless series of operations. Her family were relieved when she woke - and Ms Pitt is happily showing off her reconstructed nose on social media.

01ec3bd760e4062d4e9e18a99238854bcd008ee9,"An eight-grade girl accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in adult jail while awaiting trial, a judge. A defense petition to return 14-year-old Jamie Silvonek to the juvenile facility where she was initially sent after the body of 54-year-old Cheryl Silvonek was discovered last month was denied by Lehigh County Judge Maria Dantos on Friday. District Attorney Jim Martin had opposed the petition on behalf of the teenager, who is charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy. Her boyfriend, Caleb Barnes, 20, who is from El Paso, Texas, but was stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland, is charged with homicide. JamieSilvonek, the eighth-grader accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in an adult jail while awaiting trial, it was ruled on Friday . Cheryl Silvonek's body was found with stab wounds in a shallow grave about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and her vehicle partially submerged in a pond a few miles from the family home. Jamie Silvonek was sent to the county jail this month after she was charged as an adult and is in the women's housing unit, away from older inmates, county officials said. Authorities said Barnes and the teenager met in October, when she was 13, but she told him she was 17. Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. The teen's mother found out about their relationship in early March and ordered them to end it. A day later, the teen told Barnes in a text message, 'I want her gone,' police said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. The 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. 14-year-old JamieSilvonek allegedly conspired to kill her mother Cheryl Silvonek with her 20-year-old boyfriend 'because she disapproved of their relationship' Barnes confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, and that given the age disparity 'there has to be some type of duress or coercion'. He said his client 'cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom' and she feared for her life and that of her father. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life . Police found the body of Cheryl Silvonek in a shallow grave a few miles from her home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby ."

Smith-Walker and alleged co-conspirator Minnie Andrea Johnson, 20, were leaving the mall after shopping at Buckle denim store when a security guard tried to stop the two in the parking lot as they were getting into their car. Smith-Walker was driving and Johnson was in the driver's side back seat. Authorities say Johnson shut her door on the guard's left arm as he tried to reach inside the vehicle and Smith-Walker started driving as he was still connected to the car. The guard eventually freed his arm and the young women were arrested not far away from the shopping center. They were charged with unarmed robbery. The guard in that incident sustained minor injuries but did not need to be treated at the hospital."

00b1a843e1c0c857abac67f66baf78b65ee3e792,"The blood of hundreds of baby seals has stained the pristine white snow of Canada's ice floes as the world's largest annual marine mammal slaughter begins. Horrifying images taken only yesterday show seals being shot and wounded before they are dragged onto a vessel - where they clubbed to death for their fur. Photographs of this year's commercial hunt off the coast of Newfoundland were captured by animal rights charity Humane Society International (HSI) who say the baby animals 'are dying a violent death for fur products that nobody is buying'. Horrific: Humane Society International has captured shocking images of seals being clubbed to death on Canada's ice floes (pictured) as this year's 'commercial hunt' gets underway . Cruel: Images show the animals - who are eventually skinned for their fur - being shot and wounded on the thin ice before being dragged (pictured) onto vessels . Chilling: The seals who do not die from the gunshot wounds are dragged onto ships (pictured) where they are clubbed to death . Gruesome: The baby animals (pictured) are suffering a violent death 'for fur products nobody wants' according to Humane Society International . Inhumane: Some seals die from the gunshot wounds (top) while others escape into the water where they slowly die from their injuries (bottom) Blood-stained: Once the animals are shot, sealers retrieve the bodies by impaling them with a sharpened hook (pictured) which forces the seals that are still alive to violently thrash out . Cruel: The images HSI took from a helicopter above Newfoundland's ice floes show sealers (pictured) pulling the seal's blood-stained carcasses onto their ship . The disturbing images show the animals thrashing in pain as they are pulled across the blood-stained snow while others are seen impaled on the boat's deck. HSI's executive director Rebecca Aldworth said: 'This is the 17th year that I have witnessed the seal slaughter. The suffering I have seen is impossible to forget. If the killing happened in view of the public, it would have been shut down decades ago. But it occurs far offshore. 'We saw one baby seal clearly raise her head from the massive pool of blood she lay in. Another was shot and thrashed on the ice only to slip into the blood-slicked water. 'It is reprehensible that these baby seals are being killed with government financing, even as the largest seal processor in Canada admits to warehousing a stockpile of seal fur.' The Newfoundland government has authorised the killing of up to 468,000 harp, hooded and grey seals, according to HSI. They claim the seals - many of which are just a few weeks old - are shot, clubbed and skinned for their fur despite a decreasing global demand for them. Killing: Even Sir Paul McCartney who visited a seal nursery with HSI in 2006 has made an emotional plea for Canada to stop the seal hunt (pictured) Unforgiving: The animals are slaughtered in a remote region off the coast of Newfoundland (pictured) - HSI says if the killing happened in view of the public 'it would have been shut down decades ago' Brutal: Veterinary experts claim the seals are killed inhumanely in the commercial hunt (pictured) because of the harsh environment in which it occurs and the speed at which they are killed . Barbaric: HSI's executive director says 'it is reprehensible that these baby seals (pictured) are being killed with government financing' Demand: The country's largest purchaser of sealskin announced that it will no longer purchase the fur from seals who are killed and skinned (pictured) during commercial hunts . Innocent: Government reports found 98 percent of the seals (pictured) killed in the Canadian commercial seal slaughter are less than three months of age, according to HSI . The demand for seal products diminished greatly after the European Union, United States, Switzerland, Mexico, Taiwan and the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Armenia banned the trade of some or all products of commercial seal hunts. With China also blocking attempts to import seal meat into the country, the price of seal products from Canada declined rapidly and convinced many 'sealers' to abandon the act. Sir Paul McCartney who visited a seal nursery with HSI in 2006 has made an emotional plea for Canada to stop the seal hunt. The former Beatle said: 'Canada's brutal commercial seal hunt has begun, and once again thousands of baby seals will be shot and bludgeoned to make fur products that nobody wants or needs. 'Videos of the bloody seal slaughter provide the only vital evidence to demonstrate year after year that these seals are dying a horrible death for their fur.' In recent years, Newfoundland's government has reportedly dished out £6million in subsidies to seal processing plants to 'prop up the dying industry' - and announced a further £1.3million earlier this month. 'It is a double tragedy,' according to HSI spokesperson Wendy Higgins who told MailOnline: 'They [seals] are suffering for frivolous fur products and Canada can't even sell the fur because more and more countries around the world are boycotting sales because of the horrendous cruelty.' 'We want the Canadian government to offer a buy-out to the sealers and put and end to this senseless slaughter. 'The hunt is legal but that doesn't mean that the killing is always done according to what few guidelines govern the industry and HSI has frequently documented breaches. 'Even if they did always kill the seals according to the rules, it's still a dreadfully brutal process... This hunt is taking place many hundreds of miles out with absolutely no-one there to monitor what they're doing.' Immoral: Even though the hunt (pictured) is legal in Canada, animal rights campaigners say it's still a dreadfully brutal process . Shocking: The Newfoundland government has authorised the killing of up to 468,000 seals (pictured) this year, despite declining global demand for their fur . Hunted: The boss of a company who accepted government funds to continue purchasing sealskin said 'it's probably not a really good time to get in this industry' Death: As many as half-a-million seals (pictured) will be hunted and killed in this year's cull . Only this week the country's largest purchaser of sealskin announced that it will no longer purchase seal fur, citing a lack of demand and a warehouse full of it. Carino Processing Ltd also refused over £600,000 in financing from the Newfoundland government. But a new company PhocaLux International is accepting government funds and has stated it will purchase around 30,000 seal furs, according to CBC. The firm's Chief Executive told the news channel 'the markets aren't really great around the world... it's probably not a really good time to get in this industry.' Government reports confirmed that 98 percent of the seals killed in the Canadian commercial seal slaughter are pups less than three months of age, according to HSI. Veterinary experts have stated that Canada's commercial seal hunt is inherently inhumane because of the remote, harsh environment in which it occurs and the speed at which the killing is conducted for commercial and safety reasons."
a634c2e41b3e7c3dfc156cf442c1da3797626073,"A woman asked a judge on Thursday to dismiss her lawsuit against the daughter of University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban, bringing an end to a legal fight between sorority sisters that was sparked by an alcohol-fueled brawl. Attorneys for plaintiff Sarah Grimes and for Kristen Saban would not say whether there had been a settlement of the lawsuit, which was set for trial in early August. 'We are pleased that this case is over,' said Josh Hayes, a lawyer for the coach's daughter. Burying the hatchet: University of Alabama graduate Sarah Grimes (left) has dropped her lawsuit against her former sorority sister Kristen Saban (pictured right with coach dad), whom she had accused of brutally beating her . Sisters: Both Saban and Grimes pledged the Phi Mu sorority (pictured) at the University of Alabama in 2009 . Stephen Strickland, who filed the request on behalf of Grimes, declined to comment. The one-sentence dismissal motion did not give a reason for the move, but it said each woman should pay her own legal costs. Tuscaloosa County Circuit Judge James Roberts did not immediately rule on the request. Grimes sued the coach's daughter in Tuscaloosa County in 2012 over a fight they had while attending college in 2010. The lawsuit said Grimes suffered lasting injuries during the brawl, which evidence showed began over a Facebook post after a night of drinking. Arguments during a hearing and court documents showed the two women came to blows at Kristen Saban's apartment after the famous coach's daughter posted 'No one likes Sarah yayyyyy!' on Facebook. Grimes banged on Saban's bedroom door demanding that the post be deleted and the two were soon in a tussle that included pushing and hair pulling. Grimes portrayed Kristen Saban as the aggressor. Grimes said she suffered serious injuries, including a concussion and a broken nose that required surgery. But a judge in Tuscaloosa cited Alabama's 'stand your ground' law in ruling that Saban only defended herself against Grimes. Nick Saban and his wife, Terry Saban, were not parties in the lawsuit, which sought an unspecified amount of money. Girl brawl: Grimes (left) claimed in her 2012 lawsuit that she suffered lasting injuries during a boozy brawl with Saban (right) in 2010, which evidence showed began over a Facebook post after a night of drinking . Grimes' now-defunct lawsuit stated that the fight happened in the wee hours on Aug. 29, 2010, after a night of drinking at Rounders, a local bar in Tuscaloosa. The two sorority sisters and five other girlfriends were hanging out in Saban's apartment when they began to bicker over a boyfriend. Grimes told Saban to 'shut up' and that 'others were tired of listening to her,' according to court documents. Grimes told Saban she 'needed to get therapy' because she was a 'psycho' — to which Saban fired back: 'Because that worked really well for you,' court records show. Standing her ground: Saban claimed it was Grimes who attacked her first and she was just defending herself . Saban then locked herself in the bathroom, and posted on her Facebook: 'No one likes Sarah, Yayyyyy!' That's where things get murky — which each of the sorority sisters claiming in legal papers that the other beat her badly. In her testimony, Grimes said that Saban 'used both of her hands and shoved her into an open door frame,' where she hit her head. Grimes said she put 'one hand on [Saban's] throat, one hand on her chest, and threw her back' to try to get away. But Saban bounced back on top of her and 'hit her in the face more than five times,' leaving Grimes bleeding 'all over the floor and all over herself,' running down her face and into her bra. Grimes later testified that she had 'extensive' injuries, including a swelling on her left temple and a black eye. Saban presented a different version of events. She said in legal papers that, after she posted on Facebook, Grimes rushed over to confront her and began banging on her door. 'She was screaming at me to take it off and cursing, and I finally took it off, and I opened the door, and I showed her,' Saban testified, according to court records. 'I had my phone out, and I said, ""It's off. It's off."" 'And then she took both of her hands and put them around my throat.' University of Alabama coach Nick Saban (pictured) and his wife, Terry Saban, were not parties in the lawsuit . Saban added there was 'just a lot of slapping and punching, not many [punches] landing, and scratching.' Her injuries including a broken nose and scratches on her back, she testified. Kristen Saban pleaded guilty to an unspecified offense before the university's judicial board but was not prosecuted criminally, according to the suit. It said she was required to undergo psychological screening and take an anger management class. Grimes and Kristen Saban, one-time close friends, have both graduated from the university. Ms Grimes went on to become a first-grade teacher in Alabama, while her arch-rival has launched a career in marketing."

Doctors say he may not ever be able to walk. Having been diagnosed with a rare medical condition known as Pallister Killian Syndrome (PKS), his mother had to give up her job in Perth in order to provide full-time care for her son. Without an income, Stacy Maitai has been forced to survive on welfare funding of $90 a week to support her baby and her seven-year-old daughter. And the 28-year-old is not eligible for further financial assistance from Centrelink as she is not an Australian citizen. Scroll down for video . Baby Malakai (pictured) has been alive for seven months and he's never left the walls of the hospital . Mother Stacy Maitai had to give up her job in Perth in order to care for her son full-time . The newborn cannot see, cannot hear and struggles to breath. Doctors say he may not be able to walk . About 15 to 20 cases of PKS are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of Australia . PKS is a rare chromosomal disorder which affects about 200 people worldwide and 15 those cases are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of Australia. It is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications such as developmental delays, seizures and congenital heart defects. Ms Maitai has told of the heartbreaking moment she learnt about her son's condition. 'I wanted to commit suicide because I thought it was all my fault,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But then I found myself having to choose whether to escape all this and give up my son or be strong for my children by moving forward and staying with them every step of the way. 'It's been a difficult journey so far but also a blessing because I have found hope in Malakai and I know he will make it through.' The condition is often undiagnosed during pregnancy and is identified at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complication .

While Ms Maitai juggles her time between the hospital with Malakai and at home with her seven-year-old daughter Serenity, the financial strain of being without a job and dependent on $90 from welfare is taking its toll. The single mother says she is trying her best to keep food on the table but was given an eviction notice after being $4000 behind in her rent for her three-bedroom home, which costs $380 each week. A fundraising page on mycause was set up to help the struggling family, which at the time of publication raised more than $18,000. 'Our power was cut off and I thought we were going to be thrown onto the street,' Ms Maitai said. 'Luckily we've been able to use some of that fundraising money to take it straight to the real estate agent who was understanding enough to let us stay even though we had been behind in rent. 'You know, I came to Australia for a better life and I love it here. It's changed my life. I worked since moving here about four years ago and paid all my taxes. 'I was shocked when Centrelink told me I couldn't get any more assistance because I'm a Kiwi. 'With what I currently get every fortnight, it's hard to afford even just the basic things.' Not having grown up with a proper mother and father figure back in New Zealand, Ms Maitai is determined to give her children the life she never hard. 'I want to be a better parent and I want to be there for my kids,' she said. 'It's just a waiting game with Malakai and the doctors even asked me if I wanted to look after him even with his condition and I said yes. I chose to be there for him and he will make it through - I just know it.' Pallister Killian Syndrome, also known as PKS, is a rare chromosomal disorder. According to the PKS Foundation of Australia, about 200 to 300 cases of PKS have been reported worldwide. About 15 to 20 are known to be in Australia. 'Most of these cases have been diagnosed in the last five years with an increasing diagnosis rate,' the foundation states. The condition is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is more commonly discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications. Symptoms include: global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual impairment, seizures, marked hypotonia (floppiness), hearing and/or vision impairment, difficulty in feeding and oesophageal reflux, congenital heart defects, apnoea, prominent high forehead, coarse facial features as child gets older, broad nasal bridge, streaks or patches of lighter or darker skin, sparse hair or bald patches, high arched or cleft palate, shorter arms and legs, disproportionate to the body and extra nipples."
34b197e3b4c3275c3b6534930fef190aaadadf08,"The girlfriend of a teenager with a life-threatening tumour has spoken of how his condition has left him paralysed and unable to dress himself. Jahnae Jackson has put her psychology studies on hold in order to care for her long-term boyfriend, Jackson Byrnes after he was diagnosed with a stage four brain tumour four weeks ago. The 18-year-olds from northern NSW have raised over $80,000 from community generosity for his life-saving surgery to be performed on Wednesday by renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Charlie Teo. 'He's already paralysed and I have to help him do many things, including dress him' Jahnae told Daily Mail Australia. Jackson's girlfriend Jahnae Jackson (right) noticed he had developed a lump three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI . For the past week Jackson and girlfriend have been desperately raising the sum needed to pay the hospital . Jahnae knew they needed a second opinion, so she hunted online for specialist who was willing . Three weeks ago Jackson was told by doctors that the tumour was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jahnae knew they needed a second opinion, so she hunted online for a specialist who was willing to perform Jackson's urgent surgery and that's when she found Dr. Charlie Teo from The Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney. 'I had to be positive for Jackson as I knew there was always a way to help,' she said. On Monday morning they reached the target on their GoFundMe page, and although they still need an additional $45,000 to cover chemotherapy and other hospital fees, they are overwhelmed by the community support from the small town of Casino in northern NSW. 'It's absolutely unbelievable that a small town can do so much,' Jahnae said. 'It makes us feel so much better.' Although Jackson's surgery is likely to save his life, he still has a long road of rehabilitation in front of him as he will be left paralysed for some time. 'I was devastated when I found out, but I couldn't really react,' she said. The 18-year-old completed school at the end of last year and admits she wanted to go to university to study psychology or social work but has put it off due to Jackson's condition. 'I'd rather help my boyfriend out and worry about university later,' she said. Although Jackson's surgery is likely to save his life, he still has a long road of rehabilitation in front of him as he will be left paralysed for some time. Jackson said he has no nerves for the operation and instead wants to get it over and done with . After desperately fundraising for a week and finally reaching his goal, Jackson said he has no nerves for the operation. 'I just want to get in there and get it over and done with,' Jackson told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm just really thankful to the community as I didn't think we would raise this much money, it all happened so quickly.' Dr Teo, director of Sydney's Centre for Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery, said other surgeons were technically able to perform the surgery but he was the only one prepared to do it. 'People think that it's futile because he's got a malignant tumour and it's very aggressive,' Dr Teo told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's significant weakness down his left side and they think his quality of life is such that he wouldn't want to live anyway.' But Dr Teo said he makes decisions based on what his patients want. For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront for the risky surgery . Jackson Byrnes was diagnosed with a stage four tumour three weeks ago and needed $80,000 for surgery . Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his GoFundMe page, but said the family still needed more . 'If a patient really wants it and knows the risks and understands how risky the operation is I'll usually respect the patient's wishes,' he said . 'He is a lovely boy and he's only young. 'I said ""You know you're going to be paralysed"", I've told him the worst case scenario. 'He understands that and he wants to live.' Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain. Dr Teo said the $80,000 payment required for the surgery was standard. Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo is the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see Jackson paralysed . Jahnae is currently in Sydney with Jackson and his family, preparing for his surgery on Wednesday . 'Most boys his age begin their journey into adulthood with hopes , dreams and anticipation of what lies ahead and excitement of the endless opportunities of what life will bring them,' Mr Byrne's fundraising page on GoFundMe reads. 'It is not a time to be enduring a fight for your life.' Victorian finance, leasing and risk management company Morris Finance have made the largest donation to the cause by pledging $2000. Jahnae is currently in Sydney with Jackson and his family, preparing for his surgery on Wednesday. 'He needs to get some scans on Tuesday and then they will schedule his surgery for the next day,' she said. 'We are all positive.'"
e2f2bb91d9712eb194086410e8c3765e30e0a16c,"Hanging on one 93-year-old man's wall at a Kentucky nursing home was a photo collage of him and his wife. It was titled 'Lill & Bill, together forever'. That sentiment came true this week when, after 73 years of marriage, William 'Wild Bill' Wilson and his wife Lillian Karr Wilson died just two minutes apart from each other. Both Lillian, 89, and Bill were Alzheimer's patients and for the last couple of years had to live in separate nursing homes. Lillian resided at Richmond Place in Lexington, while Bill stayed at the Thomson-Hood Veterans Center in Wilmore. After 73 years of marriage, high school sweethearts Doug Wilson, 93, and Lillian Kerr Wilson, 89, passed away just two minutes apart from each other this week . But on Tuesday their connection proved strong as ever when one of their sons, Doug, received a phone call at 3.52am to inform him that his father had passed away. Just five minutes later the phone rang again. Doug said it was his mother's nursing home, calling with the same sad news. 'We all look at it as a blessing,' Doug told the Lexington-Herald Leader, 'because we're going to have one funeral for both of them.' Doug, 66, believes it will also make it easier for the family to grieve. 'We’re looking at it as a celebration of life because they had a great life,' he told the Washington Post. The couple first met in Corbin, where they were both athletes and high school sweethearts. Doug told the Lexington-Herald Leader that his parents ran off to get married and that he doesn't believe 'either one of them had the blessings of their parents.' But that didn't stop the couple, who survived a war and a number of relocations through their long marriage. Bill enlisted in the Army when World War II began. After returning from Germany, he worked and managed various department and retail stores. Doug told the Washington Post that his mother, who he said 'had great taste', could be found working alongside her husband as she designed the showroom windows. The family, which also included Doug's brothers Mike and Terry, hopped around the state and country. There were setbacks along the way. The couple unsuccessfully tried to open a shopping center in Atlanta and then one of Bill's department stores burned down and couldn't reopen after they moved back to Kentucky. The couple first met in Corbin, Kentucky and, according to their son Doug, ran off and got married without either of their parents' blessing. They spent their lives supporting and working alongside each other . But Doug said his parents had a 'driving force' to make sure their three sons received the college education they never got to have. 'They stressed college so much,' Doug said. 'And they were so proud that they had three sons who had college degrees.' And there were successes. After managing a number of stores, Bill decided to open his own realty firm. It grew from an $800 investment into a $1million-dollar company. He would also flip foreclosures, remodeling the houses before putting them back on the market. Meanwhile Lillian would repaint, wallpaper and do the trim work on the homes while Doug did the carpentry work. 'We had a great time rehabbing houses together,' he said. Bill was also known for his long-running morning radio show, where he was known as 'Wild Bill' and would organize a number of promotions and contests, including a twist-dancing competition that was so popular the police had to be brought in. The nickname stuck with Bill long after his radio show ended. He was even called 'Wild Bill' at his nursing home, where he would sometimes reenact his show in the cafeteria. Doug said he regularly drove his mother to see her husband at the Veterans center. He said that, although the couple 'didn't have communication', he believes they were 'reading each other' just by having the chance to see each other. When Doug last saw his father the Sunday before his passing, he said Bill was wearing an oxygen mask and was 'barely hanging on'. To comfort him, Doug recited the opening that Bill used to say for every one of his radio shows. 'I just told him, ""This is Wild Bill Wilson, your red-headed, freckle-faced, snaggle-toothed, snuff-dipping buddy""'. 'And underneath the mask there, he grinned real big. He heard it. I was glad of that.' Friends and family will gather on Saturday evening for a 'Celebration of life' service in honor of the devoted couple."

For the first time in the annals of boxing – as Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao step on the scales next Friday – fans will be charged for admission to a weigh-in. This formality for checking that combatants weigh no more than the stipulated poundage for each division started to become an event in its own right in 2007 when Ricky Hatton went to Las Vegas to take his Man Of La Mancha tilt at the Mayweather windmill. Floyd Mayweather with girlfriend Doralie Medina (left) and Manny Pacquiao with his wife Jinkee (right) Pacquiao with his wife and  children (left to right) Michael, Israel, Emmanuel, Princess and Queen Elizabeth . Mayweather visits SubZero Recovery in Las Vegas, a new-age version of the ice bath . No fewer than 30,000 of the Manchester Hitman's army followed him across the Atlantic and thousands of them turned up for the weigh-in. The atmosphere was electrified when Hatton yelled 'let's be having him' as Mayweather was about to follow him onto the stage. Hatton would be knocked out but there was more of the same when he went back to the MGM Grand to suffer the same fate against Pacquiao two years later. Since then weigh-ins there have turned into sound and light spectacles, taking place inside the Grand Garden Arena itself, and the audiences keep growing. The decision to sell tickets for this one has been made in the interests of safety, not profit. Up to 200,000 visitors are expected to pour into Vegas this fight week and the MGM need to control the crowds at all the associated events. Thousands of fans watched Ricky Hatton and Mayweather weigh-in at the MGM Grand Garden Arena . Hatton points towards the crowd during his heated weigh-in with Mayweather in December 2007 . Mayweather poses in his TMT clothing as he takes a break from training over the weekend . To avoid accusations of cashing in on the phenomenon the hotel and both promoters – Mayweather and Top Rank – will donate all revenue from the weigh-in to charities nominated by the Money Man and the PacMan. Mayweather and Pacquiao will be required to weigh not more than 10st 7lbs. The winner will unify the WBC (Mayweather) and WBO (Pacquiao) world welterweight titles. Wladimir Klitschko, as he makes a rare appearance in the US this Saturday, admits that at 39 he has to start considering when he might hang up those huge gloves. However, assuming he adds Bryant Jennings to his long list of victims, that will not happen before Dr Iron Fist has obliged the two young pretenders to his heavyweight throne. Namely our own Tyson Fury and America's KO sensation Deontay Wilder. Wladimir Klitschko has admitted that he is considering retirement as he approaches his 40th birthday . Klitschko says: 'I do have to start thinking about retirement.' But then the Ukrainian who boxes mostly to sell-out crowds in German football stadia, adds: 'I would like to fight Fury, which would be a huge event in Europe. 'I want to fight Wilder, to add the only remaining belt to my unified world titles.' Unusually, both men would present Klitschko with opposition as tall or, in Fury's case, even taller than his own 6ft 6in. Fury is his mandatory challenger for the WBO title. Wilder holds the WBC title which was vacated by Klitschko's brother Vitali when he retired to concentrate on the violent complexities of Ukrainian politics as Mayor of Kiev. WBC heavyweight champions Deontay Wilder looks set to face Klitschko before he hangs up his gloves . Wladimir is also the WBA, IBF, IBO and Ring magazine champion. There is another factor which will tempt him to prolong his reign even further. Currently he ranks fourth in the all-time list of successive world heavyweight title defences, with 18. Victories over Jennings – which looks to be something of a formality in New York's Madison Square Garden, would lift him level with Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes on 19. If he adds wins over Fury and Wilder he will close to within just four victories of the 25-defences record held by Joe Louis. That is likely to be an opportunity too good to refuse. Tyson Fury, pictured in action against Dereck Chisora, is Klitschko's mandatory challenger for the WBO title . The crushing defeat of Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr by the largely unheralded and, in terms of his first name, unpronounceable Pole Andrzej Fonfara, complicates Carl Froch's exit strategy from the ring. One of Froch's two dream scenarios has been a farewell fight in Las Vegas, probably against Chavez with his box office appeal for America's Hispanic population and fans south of the border in Mexico. But the namesake son of an idolised father was so badly beaten up through nine rounds in California by Fonfara – suffering the first knock down of his career in the process – that he quit on his stool. Carl Froch could choose to retire after Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr's defeat by Andrzej Fonfara last week . Inadvisedly, Chavez had agreed to a catch-weight fight with light-heavyweight contender Fonfara and is talking about going back down to Froch's super-middleweight division. Whether this former middleweight champion would still be a draw after this setback is doubtful and Froch had said before the fight that it would hurt his plans 'if Chavez got knocked out. The other swansong ambition – to fight on the City Ground of his beloved Nottingham Forest – suffered a setback when Andre Ward agreed to come to England for their mandatory WBA title unifier but not to Froch's home town. Retirement is becoming an increasingly attractive option for the Cobra. Chavez (right) was stopped after nine rounds on his return to the ring following more than a year out ."

Now New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has issued a state health alert that the synthetic marijuana product known as 'Spice' is sweeping the city, and that 160 people have been hospitalized in nine days after using the drug. Over 120 of those people were admitted to Emergency Rooms in the same week. The cannabinoid, also commonly called 'K2' or 'Mojo', is predominantly abused by teenagers and typically sold over-the-counter as incense or potpourri. State health alert: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Friday  that 'Spice', also known as 'K2' or 'Mojo', is sweeping the city, with 160 people admitted to hospital in the nine days from April 8, 120 of them in one week . 'Synthetic drugs are anything but harmless, and this rash of severe health emergencies across the state is direct proof,' Governor Cuomo said, according to The Hudson Valley News Network. 'We banned synthetic marijuana, bath salts and similar substances to avoid the disastrous results that occur – and as law enforcement and health officials continue to crack down on the use and sale of these drugs in New York, we are today issuing a health alert as a warning amidst this surge in hospitalizations.' Symptoms can range from confusion, drowsiness and headaches to increased heart rate, seizures and loss of consciousness, according to the New York State Department of Health. 'Young people may be fooled into thinking that these substances are safe because they are sold over the counter or are in colorful packaging, but they are not made for human consumption,' New York Alcohol and Substance Abuse Service s Commissioner Arlene Gonzalez Sanchez told KOCO. 'They are dangerous and can have significant, long-term effects on the brain.' But the same problem is occurring all over the U.S. Critically ill: This photo shows Jeff Stallings, who was placed in medically-induced coma alongside his older brother, Joey, after taking synthetic marijuana on APril 6 in his hometown of McComb, Mississippi . On life support: The siblings, both in their twenties, fell seriously ill earlier this month after smoking the drug, a mix of herbs that has been sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to marijuana. Above, Joey . Dangerous: The cannabinoid, also commonly called 'K2' or 'Mojo', is predominantly abused by teenagers and typically sold over the counter as incense or potpourri . Alabama Department of Public Health issued a statement last week acknowledging a rise in Spcie usage and said there had been 98 overdoses in the previous month. Synthetic marijuana a mix of herbs that has been sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to traditional marijuana. It is nicknamed Spice, Mojo, K2, Yucatan Fire, Solar Flare and Bliss, among other things. The drug is typically smoked by users. It does not give positive results in tests for cannabis. Because the herbs and chemicals in synthetic marijuana vary, it is impossible for users to know what they are smoking. They also cannot tell what concentrations they are taking - which can lead to fatal overdoses. Unlike pot, Spice can cause a huge range of symptoms, many of which can be severe. These include tremors, paranoia, seizures, vomiting, hallucinations, chest pain, cardiac problems, kidney damage and brain damage. Meanwhile in Mississippi, there were 97 cases over eight days in April, according to CNN. Two of these Mississippi cases were Jeff and Joey Stallings, brothers who were hospitalized April 6 after smoking Spice. The siblings, both in their twenties, fell seriously ill  after smoking the drug, which is a mix of herbs that has been sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to marijuana. They were hospitalized within hours of each other, when they collapsed after suffering from hallucinations, vomiting, night sweats and violent shaking. They had to be put on life support. Fortunately both were able to fight for their lives and were allowed home on April 13. Jeff Stallings, however, has suffered permanent kidney damage. Last year, California teenager Connor Eckhardt died after smoking one hit of synthetic marijuana. Connor, 19, fell asleep after taking the drug. His brain, deprived of oxygen, began to swell and he slipped into a coma. He was declared brain dead at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach hours later.

Above, Connor is pictured brain dead, surrounded by his family, shortly before his organs were donated . 'He gave into (peer pressure) - thinking that it was okay, it was somehow safe - and one hit later, he goes to sleep and never wakes up,' Connor’s father, Devin Eckhardt told KTLA at the time. Doctors were unable to detect spice in Connor's system - there is no way to trace its everchanging components. However, they knew he had taken it after finding the package of the drug in his pocket. Connor's family donated his organs after his death, in accordance with the teenager's wishes. They later created a Facebook page to warn others about the perils of synthetic marijuana. 'Connor Eckhardt died after taking ONE HIT of synthetic marijuana (SPICE, K2, POTpourri). This dangerous substance is legal. Help us save lives by sharing,' read a post on the page."

With Murray set to face Tomas Berdych in his semi-final, the man who beat him to the Australian Open and then again in the semis of Indian Wells secured his own last-four spot with a 7-5 7-5 success. Ferrer made a fast start taking the opening three matches as he dominated the world number one, but he was unable to keep the pace and was eventually hunted down on his 33rd birthday.

'I wasn't feeling the ball that great at the beginning, but I knew that I'm going to have my chances if I stayed committed, if I kept on working,' Djokovic - looking an unbreakable force this season - said on the tournament's official website. 'But I had to earn my points. I had to fight for everything that I got tonight on the court, because he wasn't going to give it to me. I knew that coming onto the court. 'I knew that he's a great competitor, that he grinds a lot, runs, and makes you play always an extra shot. That's why he's been top-10 player for so many years and he's tough to beat.' John Isner is up next for Djokovic after the American made it back-to-back wins over top-10 opponents.

It's so important for me,' Navarro told the WTA website. 'I was practicing and working all year with my team for a moment like this.'"

Katie Prager, 24, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs in September 2009 and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs. As her health continues to decline, her husband Dalton, 23, who has already received new lungs, is pleading for help. Her insurance company, Kentucky Medicaid, will not pay for the out-of-state treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, he says. Dalton pleaded: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can’t be the end of our love story. 'We are both ready to continue fighting but at this point we are running out of options and need your help. Please help me save my wife Katie.' Scroll down for video . Katie and Dalton Prager (above), who suffer from cystic fibrosis, followed their hearts and married as teens in 2011 . Katie, left, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs called Burkholderia Cepacia, and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs . Dalton has already received new lungs, but Katie is waiting as Kentucky Medicaid will not pay for the out-of-state-treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center . For the couple who put everything on the line when they first met in person in 2009, her husband can not imagine losing the love of his life who he married four years ago. In December 2014, Katie was discharged from the Pittsburgh hospital after a long stay and returned to Kentucky, but began having trouble breathing three days later. The hospital would not admit her because Medicare would not pay because she had used her lifetime maximum, the couple says. She will not be covered for the expensive out-of-state medical procedure again until she spends 60 consecutive days out of the hospital. She was admitted into University of Kentucky Hospital, but it however, does not do transplants on patients with the kind of infection that Katie has. 'Sixty days out of the hospital is not an option for her anymore. Medicaid is also not an option as it will not cover her transplant due to UPMC being 'out of network',' Dalton wrote on the couple's YouCaring page. 'After explaining to Medicaid and Pittsburgh that there are only two places in the country, who would operate, due to (the bacteria) Cepacia, (UPMC and Duke Medical Center) still refused to work together to help her. 'She is struggling to attempt to negotiate her healthcare options from her hospital bed at the University of Kentucky.' Dalton said: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can’t be the end of our love story' Only three months away from their four-year anniversary, the couple has not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received new lungs, and hope they can be together to celebrate . Katie said that she feels like efforts to get transferred to Pittsburgh are at a standstill and that something needs to be done. 'It needs to happen soon. Nervous they aren't going to accept my case and that I'll have to restart this whole process at a completely different hospital,' she wrote on the couple's Facebook page. In February, Dr. Michael Anstead who is Katie's pulmonologist at the University of Kentucky, wrote a letter to Medicaid seeking for them to make an exception and pay for Katie's care in Pittsburgh, according to CNN. But Kentucky Medicaid denied the proposal saying UPMC declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider. 'Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,' Gwenda Bond, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services wrote in a statement to CNN. 'Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application.' However, the hospital claims that Medicaid told them if they wanted to treat Katie, they would be required to sign up hundreds of doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients. 'UPMC wants to help Katie, and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen...It is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address this situation,' wrote spokeswoman Wendy Zellner. So far, the couple relies on communication on phones and computers to keep in touch . UPMC said they are want to help Katie but said it is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address the situation . While Katie seems to be caught in limbo, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they are working to find a solution concerning her case by reaching out to the state agency. Only three months away from their four year anniversary in July, the couple have not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received his lung transplant at UPMC. Even though he also had Cepacia like Katie, which makes lung transplants more complicated, his has been a success. However, he has not been able to be near his wife in person until she receives a lung transplant because of the risk of infection. So far, they rely on communication through their phones or computers. But all they want is to be able to spend their anniversary together. 'I just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in July and be able to hold hands and just hug,' Katie told CNN. 'That's all I really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary.' So far, the couple's YouCaring page has raised $43,425 in donations out of its goal of $50,000."

While the chilling song 'Goodbye My Lover' by James Blunt is playing in the background, the distressing three-minute footage shows Chris Ball repeatedly saying that no one should take the blame for his disease and expressing his unconditional love for his mother, four siblings and his girlfriend. On September 14 last year, Chris's brother Jayden - who is only one year younger - and their stepfather found Chris's body along with a USB stick containing the video sitting on top of a piece of paper which simply said: 'Mum and Dad, please watch.' His family have shared the heartbreaking video publicly to raise awareness of the crippling disease, which takes the lives of more young Australians than car accidents and skin cancer, as part of a petition to call for more beds for suicidal youths in hospitals. Scroll down for video . Chris Ball made made the most heartbreaking final goodbye video to his family before taking his own life . Jayden (centre pictured with siblings Matthew, Lara, Maddy and Chris from left to right) found his brother after the devastating tragedy . Chris starts off saying to the camera that this could be his last goodbye and then tells no one to blame themselves because 'depression is a disease and I'm pretty weak-hearted - it doesn't take much for me to get emotional,' he said. 'I just want you to know that I love you all and there was nothing you could have done - it's just me, my personality it's who I am.' He then goes onto talk about his ongoing battle with depression. 'I've been feeling lonely for a while, I know I could get better - I keep trying to tell myself that but I just can't see it,' he said. 'I use alcohol a little bit to help me to get through but if anyone puts on this USB - I love you - there is nothing you could really do.' Chris then signs off by naming all of the most important people in his life - his parents, four siblings and his girlfriend, Holly. 'Holly don't blame yourself - it's not your fault - same with my family - Mum, Dad, Maddy, Lara, Matt, Jay - all of you just didn't do it alright? This is me, myself - I love you - goodbye.' Chris (left) was taken by his mother Kerrie (right) to the hospital 11 days earlier but was sent home with 10 Valium because there was a shortage of beds . The five people in Kerrie's family who committed suicide: her nephew Andrew (top left), her brother John (bottom left) and son Chris (centre), her sister and Andrew's mum - Lenore (right) and her sister Leeann (bottom right) If anyone knows about the devastating impact of suicide it's Kerrie Keepa who has lost her brother, two sisters, nephew and now her son, Chris, to depression. Kerrie said her son would still be with her today if Chris had not been sent home from Redland hospital in Brisbane 11 days earlier because he was told there were not enough beds available. A Metro South Health spokeswoman said it would be inappropriate to provide any details of Chris's care while the coroner was still investigating the matter. 'However, Metro South Addiction and Mental Health Service did provide extensive support to Mr Ball and sufficient mental health beds are available within the Metro South Health area,' she said. On September 3, Kerrie received a hysterical phone call from her son who said he had deliberately cut himself multiple times on his leg. 'We had to wait for four hours and then a doctor gave him 10 Valium and told him to get a good night's sleep and that somebody would contact him in a week or two from the outpatients' department,' she said. 'Then he said to me ""you can look after him can't you?"". 'I said to him ""please don't take this lightly - there is a history of mental illness in my family"" and he just said that there were no beds.' Chris said in his video that his family and girlfriend were not to blame for his 'disease' 'I've been feeling lonely for a while, I know I could get better - I keep trying to tell myself that but I just can't see it,' he said in his video . Although Chris had been suffering from depression for the past two and a half years and had spent two weeks in the hospital during that time after making an attempt on his life, Kerrie said it was the worst state that she had seen her son in. 'I took him to my house and he was so withdrawn and crying the whole time,' she said. 'His best friend Adam and I were on 24 hour suicide watch. 'It was the worst time of my life - I have never seen him so low.' Ten days later, Chris told his mother that Holly was picking him up and taking him to his place so he could have a few drinks with his friends. The next morning, Kerrie was unable to get hold of Chris in her break at work so she asked her husband and Jayden to check on him. 'They heard music but he didn't answer the door so they broke it down and it was Jayden who found him.' Only a year apart in age, Jayden and Chris were not only brothers but best friends. 'Jayden and my husband were having terrible nightmares - Jay kept seeing visions of Chris as he saw him when he broke the door down,' Kerrie said . 'The next day Queensland Mental Health offered us counselling - I just can't get my head around that they wouldn't help Chris when he was alive but offered us counselling after he died.' Before Chris became unwell two years ago, he was a happy and outgoing boy . Chris with his girlfriend Holly and his beloved dog, Bear, in happier times . Kerrie, who works for the health department as an aged care nurse, has started a petition to call on the government to urgently implement emergency suicide training in hospitals and dedicate more beds to suicidal youths in hospitals. 'I will hand deliver the petition to Canberra myself and hope the bloody politicians listen,'she said. 'Mental health is rampant in my family so if any other family members show any sign they have no hope. 'I don't know if I could cope losing another child I think it would be the thing that breaks me - my days are filled with fear.' No matter what happens, Kerrie will always treasure the fond memories of her beautiful son. 'He was the most beautiful boy - he really loved his family - he would walk in and say ""I love you Mother Duck"" and give me a big hug and kiss,' she said. 'Before he became unwell - he was happy and outgoing with a smile that lit up the whole room.' To sign Kerrie's petition go to change.org.

There was a frantic sense of do or die in the closing stages at the King Power stadium. Pearson and his players surely knew anything less than three points against West Ham, a side who have not won away from home since December 2nd, would see them doomed to relegation. At the final whistle, the players went to all four corners of the stadium to applaud their fans. Just four points behind Sunderland with six of their eight remaining games to be played at home, it is very much game on for Foxes. Andy King was the hero as Premier League strugglers Leicester City struck late to earn a vital three points against West Ham United . Leicester City hero King is joined by veteran striker David Nugent following the Welsh midfielder's late winner against West Ham United . Seasoned professional Nugent had the chance to all but secure Leicester City victory but the striker missed from the spot . Nugent saw his penalty kick thwarted by West Ham United's Spanish goalkeeper Adrian during the Premier League clash at the King Power . It was eyeballs out, quickfire action from the 80th minute. The Hammers had a flurry of chances with Schmeichel forced into two good saves and at the other end Aaron Cresswell made a miraculous block on the line to deny a Andrej Kramaric effort. But substitute Kramaric supplied Jamie Vardy whose scuffed shot was tapped in by King from two yards out. Pearson and his opposite number Sam Allardyce embraced and shared a raucous laugh before kick-off. Both are somewhat relieved of pressure. Nugent rues his missed opportunity as the former England international is denied a goal for relegation threatened Leicester City . West Ham United instantly punish the Foxes as Senegalese international Cheikhou Kouyate  scores their past Kasper Schmeichel . Leicester: (4-2-3-1) Schmeichel 6.5; De Laet 6 (King 79 6), Morgan 6, Huth 5.5, Schlupp 6; James 6.5, Cambiasso 7.5; Mahrez 7 (Albrighton, 45 7), Nugent 6, Vardy 7; Ulloa 6 (Kramaric 72 8) Subs: Konchesky, Drinkwater, King, Albrighton, Wasilewski, Schwarzer, Kramaric .

West Ham United's Senegalese international Kouyate  celebrates after scoring to make it 1-1 while Wes Morgan appeals to the linesman . Leicester City take the lead via a spectacular effort from footballing legend Esteban Cambiasso at the King Power Stadium on Saturday . Cambiasso celebrates after scoring to make it 1-0 during the Premier League match between Leicester City and West Ham United . West Ham have had their Premier League survival all but assured since before Christmas and it appears even securing a finish outside of the Premier League’s bottom six for a third successive season – a feat not achieved since the last century – cannot win Allardyce a new contract. Meanwhile nobody realistically expected Leicester to escape their current predicament at the foot of the Barclay’s Premier League and seven points from safety before this game. If they do it will represent a remarkable turnaround in results. The message pre-match from Pearson and midfielder Jamie Vardy was that if they could recapture the spirit they showed in a 4-3 defeat against Leicester a fortnight ago they would overcome the Hammers. In starting the consistently lively Riyad Mahrez, an attacking intent was demonstrated and the home side were lively from the start. James Collins, the 31-year-old Welshman, made several important clearances in the first ten minutes for West Ham and the travelling fans responded with a chorus of ‘he’s the ginger Pele.’ But it was as he retreated to goal that the ball ricocheted off his back and into the path of Esteban Cambiasso who cooly put Leicester ahead after 12 minutes. The ball bounced kindly for the Argentinian whose sublime right footed strike just outside the D sailed in. As his teammates rushed to celebrate, he showed a wise head by urging them to get back into position. Cambiasso slides to his knees as he celebrates in front of the Leicester City fans following his opener for the relegation threatened Foxes . Leonardo Ulloa  draws a foul from Carl Jenkinson  during the Barclays Premier league match Leicester City and West Ham United . Moments later referee Mark Clattenburg made the right decision to award the home side a penalty after Carl Jenkinson brought down Leonardo Ulloa. But David Nugent's effort from the spot was woeful, low, right down the middle and easily saved by Adrian. They were left to rue the missed opportunity when the Hammers pulled one back in the 32nd minute. Alex Song sent a floating ball into he box which soared over the head Jeffrey Schupp and was controlled by Cheikou Kouyate, the Senegalese firing low and powerfully into the bottom left corner past a helpless Kasper Schmeichel. Kouyate was close to doubling his goal tally in the 73rd minute, his shot from Sakho’s lay off hitting the post. Meanwhile Vardy had two good chances in as many minutes. In a thrilling display of end-to-end action both sides demonstrated the best of their attacking wares and some rather poor defending too but ultimately Leicester deserved to come out on top.

An increased number of police and other emergency crews continue to scour the thick bushland areas around Lake Eildon in an effort to find the boy. Search co-ordinator Acting Senior Sergeant Andrew Walker said Luke had a “very high pain tolerance”, a factor that would work in his favour given he has now been missing for days. Scroll down for video . The Shambrook family with children (left to right) Luke, 11, Lauren, 7, and Matthew, 10 . Luke Shambrook was last seen on the national park at 9.30am on Good Friday. It is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since . “Hence the reason why we’re out searching. We’re still hopeful that we can find him,” Sgt Walker said. The 11-year-old, who is autistic, was reportedly seen walking near the Devils River on Sunday, four kilometres south of his campsite where he was last seen. Search crews have rushed to the location and police remain comfortable that the young boy is still alive. Luke has now been missing for four days. A Victorian Police spokeswoman told AAP late on Sunday that a family saw a young boy matching Lukes description while they were driving in the Devils River vicinity. With temperatures dropping to as low as eight degree Celsius, Senior Sergeant Ralph Willingham believes that the fourth day of searching will have a further level of urgency. 'The advice I'm getting from our search and rescue experts having regard to the overnight temperatures and the daytime temperatures is that he could well still be out there,' he said. 'We've got to be realists but we're positive, the family's positive.' However, Luke may not even know he is lost and is known to frequently hide, according to his family. He was last seen leaving Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park near Lake Eildon at 9.30am on Good Friday. Luke has limited speech and his family says he is probably confused, and he may not even be aware he is lost. Campers are helping rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES volunteers in the search of thick bushland. Police hold hope that Luke has been able to stay reasonably warm as he was last seen wearing a beanie and warm jacket. There was a moment of hope when a beanie was found by the search party, however it was decided it did not belong to Luke.

Having met Luke's family during a push to open a special school in Melbourne's southeast, Opposition emergency services spokeman Brad Battin says it's devastating to hear the 11-year-old is missing. He says Luke's parents Tim and Rachel have been updating him on the search and appreciate the efforts of all those out looking for their little boy. 'He's a lovely young kid,' Mr Battin told AAP on Sunday. 'He displays all the characteristics of a child with autism, which means he might not even think he is lost.' Sergeant Greg Paul says the search is focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland. 'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush, we've got a lot searchers searching all the tracks and in between the tracks and the gullies and the spurs,' he told reporters on Saturday. The Shambrook family has thanked emergency service workers, volunteers, family and friends for their help. They say the disappearance is completely out of character for him. A widespread search is being carried by search and rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES members, along with campers around the surrounding areas. A large search is being carried by a medley of search and rescue teams . Sergeant Greg Paul said the search was focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland. 'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush,' he told reporters on Saturday. 'We've also got people walking the banks of the lake.' But he outlined a serious hurdle for the search efforts, according to ABC. 'With the autistic condition, Luke might not respond to searchers, he may not even know that he's lost,' he said. 'He won't necessarily respond to his name being called, but that might change a little bit as he gets hungry maybe. Sgt Paul said there were hundreds of other campers in the area over the busy Easter period, so there was a chance someone else could spot Luke. Luke is described as being of medium build, about 150 cm tall with olive skin, brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a black windcheater, black t-shirt, grey track-pants, grey boots and a scarf.

Sterling has been offered a £100,000-a-week deal to stay on Merseyside and revealed in a BBC interview on Wednesday that he would have signed for a lot less a year ago. But in an in-depth TV discussion that Liverpool knew nothing about until shortly before it was aired the 20-year-old admitted that it was 'quite flattering' to be linked to Arsenal – who Liverpool face on Saturday in the Barclays Premier League – and that he used to dream of playing abroad. Raheem Sterling has turned down a new deal with Liverpool and put off contract talks until the summer . Sterling, pictured celebrating a goal for England, says he does not want to be seen as a money-grabber . Sterling's current £35,000-a-week deal at Liverpool has two years to run at the end of this season .

Assists: 1 . Liverpool are infuriated by Sterling's decision to give the interview without even telling them and some members of the club's hierarchy are convinced that the England international and his representatives are simply preparing the way for a move this summer. 'It's not about the money at all,' Sterling said. 'It's never been about money. I talk about winning trophies throughout my career. That's all I talk about. 'I don't talk about how many cars I'm going to drive, how many houses I've got. I just purely want to be the best I can be. 'I don't want to be perceived as a money-grabbing 20-year-old. 'I try to kill it off, but I don't think the public can see it that way. 'I think they just see it as this 20-year-old boy being greedy. 'I just want to take the time to think about what I've achieved in my career so far, where I need to go and what I need to do to get better as a player. Sterling says that he would have signed a less lucrative deal if he had been offered one at this stage last year . Sterling has confirmed that he rejected an offer of £100,000-a-week to stay at Liverpool . Sterling takes on Lithuania's Georgas Freidgeimas during England's Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley . 'Everyone's dream growing up is seeing themselves in an away kit somewhere in a sunny country. But, in reality, I'm happy to be playing for Liverpool and trying to win trophies.' 'If, at that point in time [last season], I was offered a contract, I most definitely would have signed straight away, probably for far less money than being said now. 'I just think the timing was a bit off.' Sterling's stand-off with Liverpool has been a theme of the club's season so far. Liverpool fans will be desperate for him to stay but it would now appear that the gap between himself and his club is widening. Manager Brendan Rodgers is aware of Sterling's comments and will address them as part of his weekly press conference on Friday. It is understood that he will not allow the issue to cloud his judgement ahead of his selection for Saturday's game and that Sterling – if fit – will play at the Emirates. Equally, however, Liverpool's American owners will not allow themselves to be bullied over this issue and are prepared to stand firm – just as they did with Luis Suarez in 2013 – unless they receive an astronomical offer for a player they value in excess of £50m.

It was not clear what caused the explosion at the Fresno County Sheriff's gun range that brought traffic in the area to a halt. The explosion on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas happened while an equipment operator and a group of county jail inmates were expanding a road alongside Highway 99, according to Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims. Scroll down for video . A fireball erupts after a large gas pipeline exploded in Fresno, California, on Friday. The explosion and fire closed both directions of Highway 99, authorities said . A firefighter watches the blaze shot well over 100 feet into the air. Eleven people were injured, three critically, in the explosion . The flames shot well over 100 feet into the air, witnesses said. Traffic heading north and south on Highway 99 in Fresno was halted by the explosion about 2.30pm as flames towered over the roadway, the California Highway Patrol reported. The highway was reopened three hours later, the CHP said. The driver of the front-loader was a county public works employee who had been working at the shooting range all day working on a tall berm that confines gunfire to the range, Mims said. Ten inmates and the operator were hospitalized, she said. Three inmates were evaluated and sent back to jail, and two deputies were being evaluated for ringing ears and exposure to the hot blast. Four patients were being treated at Community Regional Medical Center's burn and trauma unit, spokeswoman Mary Lisa Russell said. Three of them are in critical condition and one is in serious condition. The explosion on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas happened at the gun range while an equipment operator and a group of county jail inmates were expanding a road, according to authorities . Pacific Gas & Electric crews are seen in the distance along the Fresno road after the massive explosion . Four other patients were taken to St. Agnes Hospital and three more to Madera Community Hospital. Asked whether the driver was scraping or digging the earth when the gas exploded, Mims said her office is investigating. 'Hopefully we'll be able to speak to the worker to see what action he was taking at the time,' she said. Mims noted PG&E had, some time ago, marked the location of gas lines in the construction zones. The flames prompted a two-alarm call of firefighters, said Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department. A nearby rail line was also halted out of concern that a passing train could spark leaking gas. Kevin Ling was driving by shortly after the blast, and he saw fire flying into the sky. 'As I got closer, the flames were just bigger and bigger,' he said. 'It was shooting up to 200 feet or more, and a fireball maybe ten-to-15 feet in diameter. It was like out of a movie.' 'My window was up and my AC was on and it still felt like a furnace inside my car,' he added. Emergency respondents gather near the scene of a gas line rupture. Those who were injured were taken to several different hospitals in the area . Highway 99, a major highway in central California, was closed in both directions after the gas-line explosion . The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Martinez said. A front-loader was in the area, but it's unclear if the vehicle was digging at the time of the explosion, he said, adding that 'it was a large explosion that shook the surrounding area'. PG&E spokesman Denny Boyles said the pipeline was damaged by a vehicle and that the line was buried but he didn't know how deeply. The flame from the pipe was extinguished at about an hour and a half after the blast, he said. Another PG&E spokesman, Keith Stephens, referred questions to local authorities. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are reported to be injured,' he said. The Fresno County Sheriff's Office is investigation as to whether the driver of a front-loader doing work in the area was scraping or digging the earth when the gas exploded . The California Public Utilities Commission said in a statement that it is investigating the explosion in cooperation with the Federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. PG&E's natural-gas operations have been under scrutiny following a fiery 2010 PG&E pipeline blast that killed eight people in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno. National Transportation Safety Board investigators blamed faulty safety practices by PG&E, and lax oversight by state regulators, for the 2010 blast. Earlier this month, state regulators leveled the state's biggest-ever penalty against a utility - $1.6billion - against PG&E for the San Bruno blast. California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker said at the time that continuing safety citations against the utility made him doubt that the utility had embraced a culture of safety, and he raised the possibility of breaking apart the utility's gas and electric operations. The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department, said . Ten inmates and the operator were hospitalized, she said. Three inmates were evaluated and sent back to jail, and two deputies were being evaluated for ringing ears and exposure to the hot blast ."

74f0e9fa5d3efa907fbc35f56cbcaa15634dbcd1,"When retired hairdresser Theodosia Aresti, 71, moved into a new-build flat in London five years ago, the frail pensioner thought she had found her dream home. But after a blocked pipe unleashed a 'tsunami of sewage' from the nine-storey building's 239 other flats into her apartment, her hopes of a contented retirement were ruined - and she says she now hopes to move. Mrs Aresti's nightmare began when she noticed a foul smell coming from her bathroom and discovered an unidentifiable brown substance bubbling up through the plughole in her bath. Scroll down for video . Traumatic: Theodosia Aresti was left devastated when her flat became flooded with raw sewage . 'I always keep my bath clean and I looked down and all I could see was this brown stuff coming out,' she remembers. 'It was bad. It was very bad. Within half an hour, it [the bath] was over half full.' But worse was to come. '10, 20 minutes later, the bath stopped filling  but the toilet, it made a terrific noise and then, when I looked, it was half full. 'Then it started filling up and filling up and filling up. And then it was gushing out. It started flooding the flat everywhere.' With raw sewage pouring into her flat, Mrs Aresti phoned her daughter Kiki and grandson Nicos and begged them to come to her aid. She also got in touch with the company in charge of maintaining the nine-story block of flats to tell them that waste was pouring into her flat. 'I phoned the maintenance people and I said, it looks like sewage stuff coming out the bath. He said, sorry, no, no, no, you should get a plumber because I'm busy and it's Sunday. Disgusting: The flood started with her bath, which started filling up with 'brown lumps' Overflowing: Mrs Aresti's toilet began overflowing with sewage 'like a volcano' according to grandson Nicos . Revolting: The toilet and bath both began overflowing with sewage, flooding Mrs Aresti's flat in the process . 'When the man arrived, it was too late. He was too late. Everything was ruined.' Grandson Nicos Doukanaris was one of the first to come to his grandmother's aid and says the toilet resembled a 'volcano'. 'I came in through the front door and I could see the toilet,' he remembers. 'It was like a volcano, that's how bad it was. Just never ending. You could see she was visibly distraught.' But worse was to come. Despite the best efforts of the plumber, who spent four hours trying to stem the tide of sewage, the excrement was strewn all over the flat and had soaked into carpets. Worst of all was the mess in her bedroom which, according to daughter Kiki, both smelled 'foul' and 'was unhealthy' thanks to the sodden carpet. Maintenance workers, however, were unable to visit for four days - leaving a distressed Mrs Aresti to sleep in a room filled with sewage for three nights. Devastated: The disgusting episode has left Mrs Aresti desperate to find a new home . Furious: Mrs Aresti's daughter Kiki and grandson Nicos were took part in the clean-up operation . Damage: Mrs Aresti's bedroom carpet was soaked in sewage and had to be replaced afterwards . 'The bedroom it was soaked,' she says. 'The carpet was full of sewage but I was still sleeping in there. It was disgusting. I felt dirty, I couldn't eat. All I was doing was just crying.' Eventually, workmen came in to remove the carpet but when they lifted it up, the movement caused her wardrobe to collapse - soaking everything in it in sewage. It was, says Kiki, the final straw for her mother. 'It was one thing after another and it just destroyed her flat completely,' she says. 'It almost gave her a nervous breakdown.' Although Mrs Aresti's carpet has now been replaced and her flat fumigated, she says the experience has left her desperate to find a new home. 'If I could afford to move, I would move from here tomorrow because I just don't feel happy any more,' she says. 'But I don't know how I'm going to be able to do it. I'm just going to have to wait.'"
e76615c98ff22e65662dec97d7a48a7cc57d831d,"A few blocks from the finish line and even closer to the spot where the second bomb exploded during the 2013 Boston Marathon, race organizers are building a combination clubhouse, interactive museum and retail store that, for the first time, gives them a year-round, public presence. The Boston RunBase scheduled to open April 16 will allow visitors to learn about the world's most prestigious road race, run a replica of the course on a treadmill or see artifacts from its 118-year history. It will give runners a place to gather before going for a jog by the Charles River, and then shower and change before heading back to work or to the convention center across the street. Construction: Joe Clifford paints the ceiling of RunBase near the 26-mile mark of the Boston Marathon, in Boston on Wednesday . Champion: A gold laurel wreath, which is awarded to the winner of the Boston Marathon, is displayed at the Boston Athletic Association. The wreath, and other historic items from the race, will be on display when RunBase opens later in April . Location: RunBase is just a few blocks from the marathon finish line, and even nearer to the spot where the second bomb exploded during the 2013 race. Runners are seen here during the 2013 Boston Marathon . If they want to pick up a pair of shoes or a Boston Marathon jacket, they can do that, too. 'This RunBase is the front door,' Tom Grilk, the executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, said this week before checking in on the construction at the Boylston Street storefront. 'It is intended to be a place where the visitor can touch the history, the tradition of the Boston Marathon, and then get out and do something, go for a run themselves.' A combined effort between the B.A.A., Adidas and longtime shoe-seller Marathon Sports, which is providing the staff and retail know-how, the Boston RunBase is a shoeseum of sorts: part shoe store, part museum. It is the sixth RunBase for Adidas 0 the first in the U.S. But it will differ from locations from Tokyo to Prague, as well as the Nike store nearby, because of its association with the Boston Marathon. 'Not only is the Boston Marathon the Carnegie Hall of running, but Boston is an amazing running community,' said Mikal Peveto, Adidas' director of running innovation. And that became even more apparent after two bombs interrupted the 2013 race, attacks that galvanized runners and turned the Boston Marathon into a symbol of the city's resilience. 'It drew the global running community together over something that's kind of ours, as runners,' Peveto said. 'It changed everything. From something so tragic, it was incredibly powerful what came out of that ... realizing that we had something even more special than we had before.' A running club that had long been associated primarily with its flagship race, the B.A.A. had spent the last 15 years expanding its calendar to include a half-marathon in the fall and a 5K and 10K in the spring and summer. But the organization remained tucked away a few blocks from the course in offices decorated with memorabilia that can be seen, Grilk said, by 'essentially nobody.' Down the street: Boylston Street, the site of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing - as well as the finish line for the marathon itself - is now how to a Boston Marathon-themed store and clubhouse . Legacy: A cyclist pedals over the  finish line of the Boston Marathon on Wednesday. Year-round visitors to Boston have had limited options to learn the history of the race, besides visiting the course, until this month when RunBase opens . Leader: Tom Grilk, the executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, smiles during an interview regarding RunBase . 'We thought: Why not take all this stuff and bring it out to the street?' he said. 'If you can be engaged with the community, you have a chance. You may still screw things up, but you have a chance. Otherwise, you're just the guys who are stopping traffic.' The B.A.A. plans to use the RunBase for special events, including clinics and meet-ups where recreational joggers can connect or get tips from coaches before heading out on a run. Lockers and showers will save them a trip home to change; those staying at one of the Back Bay's dozens of hotels might be sent by the front desk to find a running partner or a good route for, say, a leisurely 5K. The site is about one block after marathon runners turn off of Hereford Street for the final stretch to the finish line, not far from the Charles River Esplanade that is one of the city's prettiest backdrops for a run. It is across the street from the Hynes Convention Center, which hosts a shoulder-to-shoulder runners' expo on marathon weekend and events throughout the year. 'For me, it doesn't matter if it's a dental convention or a running convention,' Peveto said. 'Right outside on Boylston Street, when they walk outside, they're going to see that RunBase.' Much of the memorabilia had been on display in the B.A.A. offices. Other items, like the sweatshirt Kathrine Switzer wore when she became the first woman to enter the race — and when a race official tried to bodily remove her from the course — were locked away in drawers. Now they will be included in rotating exhibits, along with records of every Boston Marathon competitor in one place for the first time. 'You could go in there and say, ""Hey, my dad ran this in 1972."" And click, click, click, you could look up your dad,' Peveto said. Said B.A.A. spokesman Jack Fleming: 'This will be our Ellis Island.' 'When someone participates in the Boston Marathon, they feel like they are added to the honor roll. It's almost like being a part of an alumni association: You just have that connection with the people that have preceded you,' he said. 'And you know that you are following, literally, in their footsteps.'"
2d4a9718592d8ab6a96ad11d6396196fa855767a,"A father whose 20-year-old daughter was found murdered in Iowa last year made a desperate plea from China for U.S. authorities to do more in tracking down her killer, six months after the girl's body was discovered. And police in Iowa seem to have now answered it, by issuing a warrant for the girl's boyfriend, according to reports. Tong Shao, a chemical engineering student at Iowa State University, went missing in September 2014. After a three week search, police found her body stuffed in the trunk of her Toyota Camry in Iowa City. Shao's boyfriend, Xiangnan Li, 23, was listed as a person of interest in the case and is believed to have been the last person to see her alive, however he bought a one-way ticket to China in the days after his girlfriend went missing and has disappeared, CNN reported. Wanted for murder: An arrest warrant has reportedly been issued for , Xiangnan Li, 23 (right), the boyfriend of Tong Shaom 20 (left), a University of Iowa student found murdered in September after going missing . Li had transferred to Iowa from Rochester Institute of Technology to be closer to Tong. The two had meet studying English in Beijing in 2011. They had checked into a hotel room together on September 5, 2014. The pair had stayed at the same hotel three times before and the owner knew them. According to police records obtained by CNN, two days earlier Tong had accidentally called Li - or 'pocket dialed' him - and he stayed on the line for 30 minutes, overhearing a conversation. Tong was complaining about Li to a friend and said things that 'were not nice', the records noted. The owner of the hotel told investigators Li left the hotel either on the night of September 6 or the morning of September 7, which he said was unusual, because he usually had to tell the couple to leave after the checkout time of 11am. Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8. He landed September 10. Before Li left Iowa, a text from his phone was sent to one of Tong's roommates. 'This message was purportedly from (Tong) and read that Li had an emergency in China and was flying back there, that she was going to take a bus to Minnesota to visit friends, and she would return in about a week,' the police documents stated. On September 9, Karen Yang, a friend of Li's sent him a message asking how things were going with Tong. 'Fine for now,' he replied. Killed: Tong Shao, 20, was found dead in her Toyota Camry on September 26 at an apartment complex in southeast Iowa City. Police believe she had been in the car for three weeks . Disappeared: Police say Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8, less than two days after his girlfriend was last seen alive . Tong's roommate, Jean, filed a missing person report on September 18, when she couldn't contact her. Together her roommates reached out to Tong's friends in Minnesota via social media, however they had not heard from her. On September 26 were body was found in her car parked near a low income housing complex on the outskirts of Iowa City. Residents had reported a foul smell, and responding officers wore Hazmat suits while inspecting the car, KCCI 8 reported at the time. Tong was found in the trunk, where her body had been for about three weeks, and next to her was a 15-pound barbell. An autopsy showed Tong died of  asphyxiation and blunt force trauma. A towel from the hotel had been wrapped around her head, according to police records. Inside the car police found copies of Li's flight information. Scene: Investigators had to don Hazmat suits to inspect Tong's car. Her body is believed to have been in the trunk for three weeks before they found it . Investigation: Tong died of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. Her body was wrapped in a towel, and next to it was a 15-pound barbell, police say . Stench: Investigators grimace at the smell emanating from Tong's car after finding it dumped in September . A search of their hotel room found 'splatters and drips of various dried liquids throughout the room and behind the headboards of the beds,' the records said, concluding that 'it is possible her death may have occurred in the hotel room'. Tong's father, Chunsheng Shao, told CNN he was informed by detectives last month that an arrest warrant had been issued for Li. Li is wanted for the first-degree murder of Tong Shao. Police would not confirm this, saying their investigations are ongoing. While it is the first break in the case since the discovery of Tong's body, Mr Shao says he wants more to be done in solving his daughter's murder. Mr Shao and his wife saved $100,000 to send their daughter to university, and believed Iowa would be a quiet, safe place for her. 'We've given all our love to our daughter'"" Mr Shao said. 'I feel my life is meaningless after losing her.' Tragic: Tong, a junior chemical engineering student from China, was last seen in Ames more than three weeks before her body was discovered . While the U.S. has strong ties with China, there is no extradition treaty between the two. Legal experts say the most likely outcome is that China would prosecute people within China for crimes committed elsewhere. For Mr Shao, more needs to be done. 'We now plead with you, the U.S. authorities ...  share the evidence you have gathered with the Chinese authorities,' he said. 'This honorable act could very well save the life of other innocent and vulnerable victims, and will most assuredly allow the soul of our precious daughter to be comforted and rest in peace.'"

November 2013 - Kinsman drops out of FSU, later claiming she received death threats for claiming she was raped by Winston. December 5, 2013 - Meggs decides against pursuing criminal charges, saying that evidence is insufficient. December 14, 2013 - Winston wins the Heisman Trophy, becoming the youngest player, at 19, to do so. January 6, 2014 - Winston and the Seminoles win the BCS championship against Auburn. December 21, 2014 - FSU clears Winston of any code of conduct violations after hearing presided over by retired Florida Supreme Court Justice Major Harding. He added: 'Jameis Winston in contrast has proven time and time again to be an entitled athlete who believes he can take what he wants. 'He took something here that he was not entitled to and he hurt someone. Kinsman told her alleged sexual assault story publicly in a documentary titled The Hunting Ground, which casts a critical eye on the role that fraternities, athletic departments and schools play in rape investigations on campus. Kinsman fights tears as she details her account of the December 2012 night, when as a freshman, she remembers running into a man at a Tallahassee Potbelly's, according to the Daily Beast. She says someone was creepily following her around the bar throughout the night and only stopped when a second man put his arm around her and told the pursuer he was her boyfriend. Kinsman claims that man then bought her a shot, after which she began to feel dizzy, although she faintly recalls taking a cab to an apartment. She says the next thing she remembers is coming to while the man on top of her, penetrating her, and claims that she asked him to stop. The man allegedly ignored both her and his roommate, who Kinsman says entered the room, when they told him to stop. He then took her into the bathroom, Kinsman said. There, she says, he raped her while he held her head against the tiles, and when he was finished told her, 'You can leave now.' Not knowing where the apartment was, Kinsman says she took an offer for a ride on the man's scooter back to a location she recognized, fearing what would happen if he knew where she lived. Kinsman's lawsuit, which goes into detail about the 2012 incident, accuses Winston of rape, assault, false imprisonment and emotional distress . Winston has avoided criminal charges, and a Florida State University conduct code hearing found there was not enough evidence to determine whether he was guilty . According to a New York Times investigation of the ensuing police investigation, Kinsman reported the assault in the early morning immediately after it happened, but did not identify the assailant. Tallahassee Police Officer Scott Angulo wrote he 'had no real leads' until Kinsman contacted police a month later, saying she saw the man in class and heard his name called, identifying him as Winston. The lawsuit, which goes into detail about the 2012 incident, accuses Winston of rape, assault, false imprisonment and emotional distress. Because the burden of proof is much lower in a civil lawsuit than in a criminal case, Kinsman could have a better chance of winning a jury verdict if it goes to trial. David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Miami, said in a civil case the standard amounts to the 'greater weight' of the evidence, or 'merely tipping the scales in favor of the plaintiff.' In a criminal case, prosecutors must prove a person's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning jurors must be entirely convinced of guilt. Kinsman dropped out of FSU after the incident, later claiming she received death threats for claiming she was raped by Winston . A month after prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to pursue criminal charges, Winston led the Seminoles to a comeback victory against Auburn in the BCS title game . 'The scales have to be tipped all the way over to the side of the prosecution,' said Weinstein, who is not involved in the case. Weinstein also said that he thought Kinsman's chances of prevailing were good, based on the detailed allegations and multiple witness statements in the lawsuit. But that doesn't mean it will be easy. 'The defense will drag her character through the mud, so this is going to be an unpleasant process for her,' he said. 'However, Winston has a lot to lose, so I foresee a settlement and not a trial.' Kinsman has also filed a lawsuit against FSU's trustees, asserting that university officials had knowledge of her alleged sexual harassment and discrimination by the star quarterback and this created a hostile educational environment for her. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, including reimbursement for tuition, damages for emotional pain and suffering and loss of past and present earning and earning capacity. Lawyers for the university's board of trustees contend the lawsuit should be dismissed because it does not show that FSU was responsible for her harassment, but they also maintain that they offered her assistance. Kinsman's story was featured in the documentary film The Hunting Ground, which is an expose on the way fraternities, athletic departments and universities affect rape investigations ."
bde684823a5e78fe3c7a21e72c3789f52acfdaf4,"It is legendary now that when the Spanish national team was coming to the boil and about to scald world football for six years, La Roja's own fans didn't even know the water was hot. Because they left Spanish soil having eked out two single-goal wins, over Peru and the USA, the booing, whistling and jeering which had pursued them around the peninsula for two years was the last thing they heard before heading off to win Euro 2008. Three trophies later, the senior team is finally in search of a reboot. The identity has been eroded by the passage of time. The transition from excellent to elderly is never fun. Spain lift the trophy at Euro 2008, but their fans had booed them before, not recognising a great team . The World Cup followed in 2010 and now it seems the right time for the old guard to hand over to youngsters . Spain won the European Championships for a second time in a row in 2012 before their World Cup failure . Spain's Under 21s celebrate winning Euro 2013 and their brilliant young players are thriving right now . Nevertheless, the current Champions League quarter-finals are beginning to say something quite interesting about Spain's 'relevo'. If you don't speak Spanish, that term might mean very little to you. But I bet you can intuit. 'Relevo' in this context is like 'relief' — as in the armed forces term for the relief watch. Those who are sent in, fresh and ready, to relieve whichever servicemen or women who have born the brunt of service for the previous day or days. Xavi, Carles Puyol, Xabi Alonso, Carlos Marchena and Joan Capdevila have done their hard miles and it is not clear what toll battle has taken on Victor Valdes, David Villa and Fernando Torres. The natural place to look for fresh, young, well-drilled recruits ready to take on the world is in the Academy graduates. So let's go there. What caught my attention is that Juan Bernat's arrival to the Champions League quarter-final for Bayern Munich at Porto last Wednesday earned Valencia a seven-figure sum as part of the incentives associated with the full back's move to Bavaria. In other words, Bernat was one of those guys, just turned 22, that both Valencia and Bayern thought might be playing 'starting' football at this elite stage of the world's most demanding soccer tournament — but, equally, he might not. The likes of Xavi (right), Barcelona's midfield metronome, have done their hard miles and can now hand over . it is not clear what toll battle has taken on striker Fernando Torres, who now plays for Atletico Madrid . This is the season when he's broken into Vicente del Bosque's senior team, scoring, and formed part of a quite remarkable chain of left backs at the Mestalla — from Jordi Alba, European Champion with Spain in 2012, now at Barcelona, through Bernat to Jose Luis Gaya, a remarkable talent who is currently locked in stalled contract talks at Valencia while Madrid stalk his availability. And if you just look a little more closely then the eight teams left to sort the wheat from the chaff this week show evidence that, beyond Bernat, Spain still have a golden harvest to bring in. For example, take a snapshot of the penultimate trophy Spain won — not Euro 2012 but Under 21 Euro 2013, beating Italy 4-2. In that final they lined up: David de Gea; Martin Montoya, Inigo Martinez, Marc Bartra, Alberto Moreno; Koke, Thiago, Asier Illarramendi; Cristian Tello, Álvaro Morata, Isco. Juan Bernat (right) played in the Champions League  and is the latest in a string of thriving Spaniards . David de Gea (right) has been in fine form for Manchester United and is a real goalkeeping talent for Spain . Of Spain U21's starting line-up at the 2013 Euros, only De Gea hasn't played UEFA football this season . Of that starting line-up only De Gea hasn't played UEFA football this season, eight of them are still in the Champions League quarter-finals while two of the substitutes, Nacho and Dani Carvajal have decent minutes in the competition. Throw in the fact that Spain's winning Under 21s coach was Julen Lopetegui, 3-1 up on Pep Guardiola's Bayern going into the second leg this week, and the progression from youth-level international football to full-fledged senior winner is going along very nicely. The eight starters and two substitutes from that 4-2 win are all now in the age range of 23 to just having turned 25. Between them they have 184 appearances in UEFA club matches — the vast majority of which are in the Champions League. Koke has played in the Final, Isco, Morata, Carvajal, Nacho and Illarramendi have won it, while Bartra and Thiago have played in a winning campaign. And it is important to throw in the fact that in last week's quarters, 20-year-old Oliver Torres (13 UEFA club matches) stood out against Bayern for Porto (he belongs to Atlético), while on the bench for the Madrid derby were fellow 20-year-olds Jese and Saul Nguez, who have 18 UEFA appearances between them. Spanish fans didn't quite know the great team they were getting in 2008, they could have another one now . Alvaro Morata (right) celebrates with team-mates after scoring against Germany at Euro 2013 in Israel . Whether they flower for club and country or bloom early but fail to excel like recent Spanish generations have proven to do, the fact remains that there is a wave of fresh, exciting Spanish talents who demand attention now. This week in fact. Lopetegui, whose result probably constitutes one of the performances of the season, has a firm view. 'I don't think there's strictly a ""Spanish school"" of coaching or playing,' he argued earlier this season. 'There's just ""training"" and ""playing"". So what I' ve always looked for are kids who know how to understand the game. I think it's a common misconception that players completely understand football and how it's played. Former Under 21 coach Julen Lopetegui has managed Porto to one of the results of the season in midweek . 'Understanding precisely what's going on in a game is not at all easy. 'The key is knowing what to do with the ball so that you don't lose possession and get caught disorganised. Never gift away space to an opponent. 'When you control the ball and space on the pitch, then you must know how to take advantage. But the line is thin, you want to make the players effective and efficient but never to kill off their creativity and capacity for invention.'"
be72d26e0d037afc332987f64bd6a04ae7416eb4,"An ex-wife of a North Carolina man serving life in prison for the murder of his third wife has opened up about the abuse she faced when she was married to the man. Amanda Casey, also of North Carolina, was married to Michael Wilkie for four years and had a daughter with him before the couple divorced. He went on to marry his third wife, Shelby Wilkie. Michael Wilkie was found guilty of first-degree murder in January for the 2012 killing of Shelby Wilkie and is serving a life sentence without parole. Amanda Casey has opened up about the abuse she faced at the hands of Michael Wilkie, who in January was found guilty of the 2012 murder of his third wife . 'He said if I ever tried to take his daughter away from him that he would kill me,' Casey told ABC's 20/20. Casey and Shelby Wilkie had met Michael Wilkie through an online dating site. Casey said they dated for a year-and-a-half before getting married. 'He was very friendly, very charming, easy to talk to, very soft spoken, and he had a good job and seemed to be pretty good,' Casey said. A couple months after marrying in 2004, Michael Wilkie began controlling aspects of Casey's life and alienating himself from Casey's daughter from a previous marriage, Casey said. 'If I planned to do something with one of my friends, he would manipulate the situation, and there would be something that came up that would interfere or get in the way,' she said. And then he began to get physically abusive and attacked her when she was pregnant with their daughter. He grabbed me around my throat and threw me around our bedroom and on the bed. My shoulder went through and made that hole in the sheetrock in the bedroom,' she said. Michael Wilkie (left) was sentenced to life in prison with no parole for killing his third wife, Shelby Wilkie (right). Shelby and Michael Wilkie, both of North Carolina, had met on an online dating site . But Casey never reported the incident and her friends and family were not aware of Michael Wilkie's abusive side because 'he was so good at masking'. 'It was like Jekyll and Hyde: two personalities and you didn't know which one you would get,' Casey said. 'You didn't know which one. You would meet when you got home.' She said she 'had thoughts' that Michael Wilkie would kill her, 'mainly because he told me he would kill me'. But Casey didn't leave Wilkie for quite some time. 'I am the type of person that I will stay in a situation, whether it's a job or a marriage … longer than I should because I don't give up hope easily,' she told 20/20. 'And I am always thinking about, 'What could I do to make it better?' After an argument about pictures taken of their daughters together in 2006, Casey left Michael Wilkie. She took her older daughter but left the couple's three-year-old behind. The couple later divorced in 2008. Casey eventually remarried and gained joint-custody of her and Michael Wilkie's child, and met her former husband's new wife, Shelby Wilkie, at a school event for their daughter. Shelby Wilkie was murdered in 2012 and her remains were found after a long search. Her and Michael Wilkie's child, Sydney (left), is in the process of being adopted by Shelby's brother, Bill Sprowls, Jr, against Michael’s wishes . She did not, however, warn Shelby Wilkie about the abuse she faced when she was married to Michael Wilkie. 'I had hoped that things had changed, and that it was me and not, you know, him. And that way, hey, he could be happy. She could be happy, and it could be a nice household environment,' Casey said about the couple. Just before Shelby Wilkie went missing the pair did have a short conversation. 'She said, 'I just want to ask you some things about Michael, is that OK?' And I said, 'Sure,' Casey recalled. 'And I said, 'Shelby, if there is anybody that knows what you are going through, it's me.' Casey told Shelby Wilkie she had to go shortly after and asked her to call her back. She never got a call back, and instead saw Michael Wilkie pleading for Shelby Wilkie to come home. Casey (right) married Michael Wilkie in 2004. She said a few months after the wedding be become controlling and eventually physically abusive. At times, she said she feared he would kill her . At first, Casey thought that Shelby Wilkie had run from her husband, but Michael Wilkie was then arrested, charged and found guilty of his wife's murder. Shelby Wilkie had filed two domestic violence charges against her husband before her death, but both were voluntarily dismissed, according to WSOC. Blood and her ashes, along with a charred bracelet her mother had given her, were later found and Michael Wilkie was arrested, according to ABC. And it wasn't until his arrest that Casey finally felt safe, she said. 'It's made me grow as a person,' she said. 'And it has made me stronger as a human being.'"
fc3c6dc7f1046c6977969184d68948134bd6a1fe,"By the time Cesc Fabregas was replaced in the final minute, the mask had gone and the jeers had melted into applause. The appreciative majority overwhelmed the vocal minority to offer a tribute to the Phantom of the Emirates, one of the finest creative midfielders to have worn an Arsenal shirt in the modern era. It’s true they had booed his every touch and perhaps the loudest cheer of the game followed his yellow card for a dive but for Arsenal it is time to stop being haunted by those they have lost or failed to sign and support those they have. Cesc Fabregas was booed by large portions of the Arsenal supporters upon his return to the Emirates . Fabregas was cheered - albeit sarcastically - by the same set of fans when he was booked for diving . However when the Chelsea midfielder was substituted in the dying moments he was given an applause . Hull (away) - May 4 . Swansea (home) - May 11 . Man United (away) - May 17 . Sunderland (home) May 20 . West Brom (home) - May 24 . There have been genuine signs of promise in N5 and reasons for optimism in 2015, even if Arsene Wenger was unable to add what would have been a significant other by ending his winless run against Jose Mourinho. It is 13 games and counting, and while the Arsenal boss insists it matters not a jot, it is much to Mourinho’s amusement. ‘It’s about our club and our team, not about me,’ said Wenger. ‘We wanted to win the game for the club. What is important is what happens on the football pitch. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand . ‘We want to finish the season well. Every game is difficult but we need to keep the focus until the end of the season. We want to secure the top four, then the top three and the top two, before the FA Cup final.’ To finish as runners-up, for the first time in a decade, and successfully defend the FA Cup, can be framed as progress. More significant is the development of Hector Bellerin, Francis Coquelin and Nacho Monreal. Together with a philosophical tweak, it has made Arsenal a more solid defensive unit, capable of taking points from Manchester City and Chelsea and winning at Manchester United in the FA Cup. Coquelin and Monreal were both ready to make smart fouls at the expense of yellow cards to stop the visitors as they sought to counter quickly. This is not a typical Arsenal trait. Bellerin has been outstanding and few have contained Eden Hazard this season as effectively as the teenager did on Sunday, but Arsenal need more defensive protection and plan to prioritise a defensive midfielder and a new goalkeeper in the summer. ‘We have closed the gap since the start of the season,’ said Wenger. ‘But what happened is that they had the experience at the back and could close the game down. ‘The build-up was quick and sharp but the final ball wasn’t there.’ With five to play, Arsenal trail the champions-elect by 10 points and must concentrate on catching Chelsea in the knowledge their rivals from the capital’s west will strengthen again in the summer. Amid the progress, there remain reasons for concern. Despite the flair overload of Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla, they could not break down a Mourinho team determined to protect their clean sheet. Spanish defender Hector Bellerin (left) has come on leaps and bounds for the Gunners this season . Francis Coquelin of Arsenal evades Fabregas of Chelsea during the 0-0 draw at Emirates Stadium on Sunday . Ozil had glimpses of goal, but Branislav Ivanovic did to Sanchez what Bellerin did to Hazard. Chelsea finished the game with a midfield trio of Nemanja Matic, Kurt Zouma and Ramires, which together with their usually resolute back four amounted to a seven-man defensive shield. In the Sky Sports studio, Arsenal legend Thierry Henry questioned the quality of 18-goal striker Olivier Giroud. ‘Wenger has to strengthen,’ said Henry. ‘In order to win the league you need great players. I don’t think you can win the league with Giroud. Nacho Monreal (left) is among the Gunners players who have impressed recently and did so against Chelsea . ‘Chelsea struggled last year but they went out to buy (Thibaut) Courtois, Cesc, Matic and (Diego) Costa. You see today the difference between a team that did and a team that didn’t strengthen. Arsenal still need four top players.’ Those four would be straight down the spine of the team. Imagine Arsenal if you threaded Courtois, John Terry, Matic and Costa through the centre of their fast and fluent side. Arsenal do not long for a Fabregas. They have players who can offer his vision and passing range. Perhaps the supporters who applauded him from the pitch have come to accept this. Thierry Henry said Arsenal will not win the Premier League if they do not buy another striker . But Chelsea do have individuals who would offer extra physical presence and match-winning know-how which would provide a platform for those like Ozil, Sanchez and Cazorla to deliver. Henry must realise this is not the Wenger way but time for nurturing is running out. The Arsenal manager has two more years on what could be his final contract. If he is to close the gap, catch Chelsea next season and end this hoodoo against Mourinho, then it must be done in the summer transfer market."
e66c6e865c9ed96d52756a51ddfb5d41b24e2194,"When she was 15 weeks pregnant with her fifth child, Clare Van Santen was told she had breast cancer. 'I was pregnant with Elijah when I found out that I had breast cancer, so it was a bit scary wondering what was going to happen with the pregnancy and the other kids,' Ms Van Santen told Daily Mail Australia. After undergoing a specific chemotherapy regime which had been found to have no negative impact on unborn children, and having a mastectomy, her son was born happy and most importantly, healthy. 'He had a full head of hair when he was born, and I was bald so that made me feel better,' Ms Van Santen, who is from Perth, joked. Singe mother-of-five Clare Van Santen, 37, (back of image) is currently battling terminal breast cancer. She is pictured here with her four youngest kids Susan 17, Nikita, 14, Jack, 12, Elijah, 9, . The Perth woman was first diagnosed when she was pregnant with her fifth child, Elijah, now aged nine . When she asked her doctor after all her treatment whether she was in remission, he told her that with breast cancer, if it is contained within the breast like hers was, you are essentially cured. But ten years on, after living a life which she thought was cancer-free, the single mum-of-five has been told her cancer is now terminal. Her biggest concern going forward is for her children, whose ages range from 20 to nine years old, and how they will live without her. 'I worry about how they’re going to be and who’s going to look after them, what’s going to happen, how they’re going to cope,' Ms Van Santen said. After her initial diagnosis, the Perth woman learned in October 2013 her cancer had spread to her liver, and she also had a small amount in one of her shoulders. 'I went to have lap-band surgery and they did a scan of my liver and found some legions which ended up being cancer, little tiny bit in my shoulder too,' Ms Van Santen revealed. Ms Van Santen has a bucket list of things she wants to do with her children: Keisha, 20, Susan 17, Nikita, 14, Jack, 12, Elijah, 9, in the time she has left . She was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005, but it has since spread to her liver, shoulder, and brain . The 37-year-old has undergone coutnless chemotherapy and radiation treatments in the past decade . Instead of the surgery she was supposed to have, she had to endure five months of chemotherapy and hormone treatments, which successfully shrunk the spots in her liver. 'For most people a Bucket List is something that has lots of adventurous things on it... My Bucket List is for me and my kids, so they can enjoy their home environment and that we can make as many happy memories as possible while I can.' - Clare Van Santen. Some of the items on the mother-of-five's list include: . Then at the beginning of this year, Ms Van Santen began having some strange symptoms once again. 'I'd been having headaches and just forgetting things, and sometimes I'd read something and the worlds had been jumbled around. 'On February 14 I had a seizure and discovered the cancer had gone to my brain,' she revealed, saying the horrible event happened in front of three of her kids. Radiation therapy is currently trying to shrink the ten tumors spread throughout her brain, but the cancer is inoperable, and devastatingly, terminal. As for how much time Ms Van Santen has left with her children, it's impossible to know. 'They can’t say,' she said, speaking of her doctors. 'They've said a few months to a few years.' Ms Van Santen has a bucket list of things she hopes to do, see and experience with her family before her time is up, but life is much harder for her than it used to be. With the time she has left she hopes to makeover the kids' rooms so they have their own sanctuary, get a 'HUGE comfortable leather lounge for me and kids to sit on, so I can be with them', and fix up other things around the house. Ms Van Santen also wants to go on a family holiday on a cruise, have a photo-shoot with her kids, and simply 'make lots of little moments special'. She has thrown her support behind Breast Cancer Care's Buying Time campaign which aims to raise money to fund more breast cancer nurses . Ms Van Santen, pictured here with eldest daughter Keisha, is not sure how much time she has left with her kids . And perhaps the most important: 'Finding someone who will love my kids nearly as much as I do!'. But the medication she currently on makes her more exhausted than 'I've ever been in my life', and leaves her wiped out for days at a time. However the mum-of-five said her life would be even more difficult if she didn't have the support of Breast Cancer Care, WA. She has thrown her support behind the Buying Time Campaign, which aims to raise money which will go towards funding more breast cancer nurses and support services. 'I've rung them crying so many times,' Ms Van Santen revealed. 'Their support is so, so amazing.' When a patient first receives their diagnosis and calls the care centre, they are allocated a nurse who helps them through their entire journey. The nurses make house calls, ring and check up on them, send counsellors out to get people through tough times and help patients get connected with support groups. She hopes to take her family on a holiday together, and get a photoshoot with everyone soon . Ms Van Santen also hopes to raise awareness about the mortality rates of women with breast cancer . 'They help with everything, if you need some financial help, or you need legal help, if you need a lift...' Ms Van Santen said. '(And) it’s good to be able to speak to other people going through the same thing,' she added, speaking of the help she received through her Stage 4 support group. Through her involvement in this campaign, Ms Van Santen also wants to help raise awareness about the mortality rates of women who suffer from breast cancer. She has questioned why she is classified as a 'survivor' because she has lived for more than five years after her diagnosis, but will still eventually succumb to the disease. Ms Van Santen said she would like to see more research done on Stage 4, or terminal, breast cancer because even though hers was detected early, it will still eventually take her life. 'So much money goes into awareness for breast cancer, but no money goes into actually researching Stage 4 cancer,' she said, adding that as it's the one that takes lives there should be more known about it. Ms Van Santen hopes in the future there can be more awareness about the mortality rates of the disease, and that people know that even if detected early, that breast cancer can still kill. 'It’s important for so many people, you know, my kids, people's families', she said. You can support the Buying Time campaign here, donate to help Clare Van Santen tick things off her bucket list here, or keep up with her journey here."
5f4d514a38e80e92d8ef84cc4f9fef3da1d3aced,"Controversial Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans is under attack again with experts warning his 'reworked' baby milk formula is dangerous to babies. Dietitians have singled out a 'happy tummy brew' in Evans' cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, because it contains almost five times the maximum vitamin A dose for a baby. The original recipe for the 'brew' contained more than 10 times the maximum daily intake of vitamin A for babies. Scroll down for video . The paleo diet has been one of the hottest diet trends around, with celebrity followers taking on the lifestyle . The Dieticians Association of Australia said the reworked formula still presents a threat to babies. 'This new infant 'brew' could seriously harm babies,' a spokeswoman for the Dieticians Association of Australia told News Corp Australia. 'The authors seem to have made a serious mistake with this second version of their liver and broth recipe, suggesting they do not understand the basic scientific and nutrition information relevant for infant feeding. 'They have said publicly that they have tried to make it safe by reworking the original recipe, and increasing the age for which it's suggested from 0-6 months to now be 6-12 months, but they have failed spectacularly to meet any safe standards.' The paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of Australians to embrace the lifestyle . Evans's co-authors, wellness blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padrin, told Channel 7 last week the dangerous formula had been reworked and renamed 'Happy Tummy Brew'. The pair told the program the recipe had changed. 'We added vitamin C and some calcium,'Carr told The Morning Show. It comes after Evans' recently shared two stories on his social media accounts of women who claimed the paleo diet helped alleviate the symptoms of their multiple sclerosis. A 30-year-old woman, Hollie, wrote she thought her life was over when she was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in September 2013. She said that she endured months of  constant dizziness, altered temperature perception, extreme fatigue, numbness in her legs and feet and fell into a period of depression. But after jumping on the Paleo diet bandwagon, Hollie claimed she has not suffered any MS symptoms over the past 12 months, her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever. Hollie's experience led the celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000-plus followers on Facebook on Saturday. Pete Evans has shared an incredible story about a woman who claims she no longer suffers multiple sclerosis . 'WOW this is powerful story on MS, thanks for sharing Hollie.. it will make your heart sing.. it has mine, please tag and share wide!' Evans wrote. The Australian chef also shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg, another MS sufferer. The woman claimed she has seen significant health improvements after being on Evans' 10 weeks Paleo program. The celebrity chef has been a proud paleo advocate . 'I have had a lot of health issues the past years, mainly auto-immune stuff including MS,' she wrote in the online post. 'Having MS means I'm always sapped of energy, have numbness, pins and needles, pain, poor concentration, etc. Not any more!' Marg said she was recently able to walk up and down a flight of 811 stairs. 'No way on earth I could have done that 10 weeks ago,' she wrote. 'My concentration and memory is much better and I can also plan better. I'm not off my MS meds yet but I am off my Thyroid and Reflux meds. 'Thanks so much Pete and team for helping me get my life back. You've made this road so easy. As an added bonus I've gone from a size 16 to a size 12.' The My Kitchen Rules judge has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting the benefits of a 'caveman diet' that cuts out grains, legumes, sugar and dairy. But, Hollie praised Evans for his endorsement of the controversial diet, and said 'the way you are changing the lives of others by leading an example is remarkable'. 'I have been inspired by your encouragement, great recipes and educated by the accurate information you provide,' Hollie wrote. 'Pete, I thank you so very much for bringing paleo in to the mainstream - people no longer look at me as though I'm a weirdo for following this way of life.' In another recent Facebook post, the Australian chef shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg who also suffers from MS . Evans has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting a controversial caveman 'diet' LaTrobe University Associate Professor of Dietetics Catherine Itsiopoulos pointed out Hollie's diet might have been unhealthy before adapting the Paleo lifestyle. 'Her diet may have been poor previously,' Dr Itsiopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are so many factors to pinpoint - specifically how her condition changed and we don't know what her diet and eating habits were like before. 'By eating lean meat, good oil and high intake of bioactive plants such as leafy and root vegetables - could all have a beneficial effect because all of these foods work significantly well together. 'But we don't actually know if her condition is cured so it's hard to advocate on because there's no scientific evidence to back this up.' The paleo lifestyle, which Evans is a long-time supporter of, bans all dairy, grains, preservatives and sugar . University of South Australia Professor of Population, Health and Nutrition Kerin O'Dea said while the diet seemed to have worked for Hollie, it might not work for others. 'Pete can share whatever he likes to his followers but there's never going to be one magic bullet to cure an illness or a serious disease,' Dr O'Dea told Daily Mail Australia. 'Someone reporting an anecdote might be true in one person's case but it's very difficult to imply it to others, which can be quite misleading for people. The paleo style of eating, which Pete Evans is a proud supporter of, has been sweeping across the globe . 'They could feel failure when it doesn't work for them, especially when they try to cure a serious condition like this. 'I wouldn't recommend any particular diet for anyone suffering any type of illnesses.' The paleo style of eating, which Evans is a proud supporter of, has swept  the globe and involves a high intake of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, some fruits, seeds and nuts."

However, a new documentary is about to blow the lid on the illegal organ trade that is now allegedly worth a staggering US$1 billion a year. This despite the fact 10,000 organs are transplanted in China every year, yet there are only a tiny number of people on the official donor register. ‘Human Harvest: China’s Organ Trafficking’ will show how once researchers around the world - including human rights lawyer David Matas and former Canadian member of parliament David Kilgour - began to uncover the gory details, the true picture was soon uncovered. Scroll down for video . A new documentary is about to blow the lid on the illegal organ trade that is now allegedly worth a staggering US$1 billion a year in China . In 2006 a non-governmental coalition was formed called ‘The Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of the Falun Gong in China’. They requested that Mr Kilgour and Mr Matas investigate allegations of organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners in China because of their extensive academic and political backgrounds and prior involvement in human rights activism. The damning evidence they uncovered suggests that tens of thousands of innocent people have been killed on demand to supply an ongoing illegal organ transplant industry. How these two Nobel Peace Prize nominees pieced together the evidence and continue to fight against this unimaginable horror is told in the program. Human rights lawyer David Matas (pictured) investigated allegations of organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners in China and uncovered some gruesome facts . ‘Human Harvest: China’s Organ Trafficking’ will show how  researchers began to uncover the gory details . The pair have spent years investigating organ trafficking in China, and it's claimed that political prisoners are being used as live organ donors. They believe the organs come from members of the Falun Gong movement – a quasi-religious group with millions of followers, which is banned by the Chinese Government. ‘I can testify that this hospital forcibly removed organs, such as livers and corneas,’ says former worker Annie of allegations that members of the banned Falun Gong movement were killed for their organs. The pair have spent years investigating organ trafficking in China, and it's claimed that political prisoners are being used as live organ donors . During a rally joined by thousands of Faul Gong practitioners at Taipei, four demonstrators play in an action drama against what they said was the Chinese communists' killing of Falun Gong followers and harvesting of their organs in concentration camps . 'Some practitioners were still breathing after their organs were removed, but they were thrown into the hospital’s incinerator anyway.' Filmmaker Leon Lee, who is based in Canada, is the man behind the documentary. He first read about the allegations in 2006 and he couldn't take it all in. ‘The story seemed too incredible to believe. Several months later, David Matas and David Kilgour published their investigation report Bloody Harvest,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I was inspired to investigate further and see for myself if this horrific story could really be and that's how it all began. Eight years later Human Harvest has been released and now you can see for yourself too.’ The China organ trade is now worth a staggering US$1 billion a year, Mr Lee claims. From 1980 onwards, China began withdrawing government funds from the health sector, expecting hospitals to start charging people for their services. According to Chinese doctors, state funding is often not even enough to cover staff salaries for one month. The China organ trade is now worth a staggering US$1 billion a year it is claimed . ‘Transplants range from about US$60,000 to over US$170, 000 depending on the operation, so there is a lot of money to be made there. Sadly the sale of organs has become a source of funding,’ Mr Lee told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Orient Organ Transplant Centre in Tianjin reported revenue of at least 100 million yuan (approximately US$16 million) on liver transplant alone in 2007. ‘That's the number in one hospital, for one kind of transplant in one year only. Now imagine the whole of China.’ Practitioners of Falun Gong protest in Parliament Square over the 10 year persecution of their spiritual discipline by the Chinese Communist Party . China outlawed Falungong as an 'evil cult' in 1999 and has since detained tens of thousands of members . The subject is still one that people find hard to believe or do not want to believe for various reasons. However, in recent years China has been heavily criticized by the UN for its use of death row prisoners for organ transplanting. Laws preventing organ tourism to China are being instated around the world and are already in place in Israel and Spain. Both US Congress and the European Parliament have passed resolutions condemning Chinese regime's practice of forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience, and asking China to stop such practice. Thousands of Falungong practitioners sit in silence in front of the presidential office in Taipei . Members of Falun Gong movement demonstrate outside the Hawaii Convention Center in Hawaii in 2011 . Canada's recent ‘Subcommittee on International Human Rights’ also unanimously passed a similar motion. ‘It's a start, but a lot still needs to be done. Awareness and action at this point is really essential, we can't keep allowing this human rights abuse to continue,’ Mr Lee said. As it would have been impossible and very dangerous to shoot in mainland China, Mr Lee filmed in several other countries and obtained footage from his sources in China. Mexican protestors demonstrate against China's actions towards the Falun Gong community . In recent years China has been heavily criticized by the UN for its use of death row prisoners for organ transplanting . ‘Finding people that wanted to talk and gaining their trust was a slow process, the film took eight years to make,’ he says. ‘It was very difficult because people fear persecution from the Chinese regime. Identities were hidden in some cases to protect those involved.’ But for all his best intentions, will anything really be done to stop this gruesome business? Particularly considering the power that China wields worldwide? Mr Lee believes that it will. China said authorities had broken no laws while cracking down on the spiritual group Falun Gong, while insisting it was a cult that violated human rights through mind control . Transplants range from about US$60,000 to over US$170, 000 depending on the operation . ‘You can help spread awareness in your networks of family and friends and hopefully this film, which is currently gaining momentum, will help to shed a light on this atrocious crime. That's the hope anyway,’ he says. ‘Human Harvest: China’s Organ Trafficking’ will be shown on Dateline on SBS One at 9.30pm on Tuesday."

51d6768c11dc3fed53bd26638336e6a9ad37c99b,"Out there in the desert, the mirage continues to shimmer for Amir Khan. The identity of the challenge becomes blurred in the haze. First it looks like Floyd Mayweather. Now he glimpses Manny Pacquiao. And in which oasis in the sand might he finally touch gloves with one of the two best boxers on earth? The initial lure has been Mayweather in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now the siren call is Pacquiao in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. For two years Khan has been so close to fighting Mayweather that he could smell the resin and hear the roar of the crowd. Yet each time he reaches out, the tantalising illusion fades and slips away like so many fantasies along the Vegas Strip. Now the image of Pacquiao dances before him and there is reason to believe that a tale which might have been told by Scheherazade could become reality one starlit Arabian night. After waiting and waiting for Floyd Mayweather, Amir Khan could be set to face Manny Pacquiao . A fight with Pacquiao, preparing to face Floyd Mayweather on May 2, is on the cards for Abu Dhabi . The handsome young prince of British boxing will pay a flying visit to Vegas on May 2, there to watch the PacMan and the Money Man dispute the richest fight of all time. Win or lose, Pacquiao could await Khan come winter. Sportsmail's Jeff Powell with Amir Khan . Bob Arum, the PacMan’s vintage promoter, has to hand a treasure trove of an offer for a fight in Abu Dhabi this November or December. Khan, the stand-by for Pacquiao had Mayweather refused the Fight of the Century, is Arum’s first choice for that extravaganza in the Middle East. Once Pacquiao’s sparring partner, now Khan says: ‘I want this fight. I would love to box Manny. We’ve been looking at an event in Dubai and Abu Dhabi is only a short drive away. It’s a dream of mine to fight in that part of the world.’ As a hero of the Muslim world, Khan would be a huge attraction there. He now has initials which are the Pakistan equivalent of a CBE behind his name. His father and mother have just returned from Islamabad where, on their son’s behalf, they received from President Mamnoon Hussain the PAPID - the President’ s Award for Pride In Performance. Arum is aware of that box office potential but also recognises the boxing qualities of the ‘nice young man’ from Bolton: ‘Amir has great speed. Maybe the only guy as fast as Manny. And his recent performances have been impressive. This would be an outstanding fight.’ Assuming that Khan wins his interim bout with Chris Algieri in New York next month, all that would appear to stand between him and his long-awaited mega-fight is the outside chance of a re-match between Pacquiao and Mayweather. Promoter Bob Arum (left), with Pacquiao and Roach after the 2009 win over Miguel Cotto, rates Khan highly . Floyd Jnr seems to have no great appetite for a second edition of May 2nd, even though a return bout might bank the man who nicknames himself Money another couple of hundred million dollars. Either way, Mayweather will conclude his enriching six-fight contract with the Showtime cable network in America in September. That timing rules out Khan as his opponent - yet again after two broken promises - because his strict observance of Ramadan would not end in time for him to prepare fully. But if it’s not a re-match and Mayweather finds another opponent, Pacquiao-Khan is a natural for both of them. Pacquiao prefers an early winter date for his second fight of a year and Khan says: ‘Late November or December is perfect for me.’ Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that if Mayweather beats Pacquiao he will want to risk his cherished unbeaten record for a second time against the most dangerous of all his opponents. Floyd Mayweather will end his six-fight deal with Showtime in September, which won't work for Khan . Pacquiao works out with trainer Freddie Roach at their base at Wild Card Boxing in Los Angeles . And Khan suspects that will be the upshot in Vegas: ‘I actually think that once Mayweather gets through Manny’s assault in the first few rounds it will become an easy win for him. ‘Manny has speed and power but Floyd has the defensive skill to avoid him and the brain and accuracy to keep picking him off as he comes in. ‘The longer it goes the harder it will get for Manny and if he is to win he will have to keep up the pace through every minute of every round.’ Khan has affection as well as respect for his old spar-mate, so it puts him in a curious position to realise that defeat for his pal would benefit himself. Khan believes Pacquiao will struggle more with Mayweather the longer their mega-fight goes on . So he says: ‘I’ll just watch it with a professional eye. And there is a chance that if Floyd’s legs really are slowing down that Manny will catch up with him - and he can punch.’ By way of further irony, Khan has been working lately to add to his high-speed aggression exactly the kind of patience he would need if he ever did fight Mayweather. Hidden away in a unit in a business park in Oakland, across the Bay from San Francisco, is the gym in which trainer Virgil Hunter hones the talents of Khan and his long-time protege Andre Ward, who will shortly make his own comeback from a long lay-off. Khan has to first overcome Chris Algieri (left), who was decked six time by Pacquiao, on May 29 in New York . But as his higher education continues under Hunter, he is buckling down. Partly in the knowledge, at 28, that these are his prime years and they must not be squandered. He says: ‘I’ve wasted the best part of a couple of years waiting for Floyd because I would love to be the man who beat the man considered the best pound-for-pound in the world. Now I have to make the most of every day because soon it may be too late. ‘Floyd and Manny are getting closer to retirement and if I don’t fight one of them soon it may never happen.’ That is one of the reasons why Khan puts on hold a Battle of Britain with Kell Brook, preferring to focus on selling himself in America and thereby stay at the front of the queue for a shot at Pacquiao or Mayweather. Kell Brook (left) is fighting Frankie Gavin (right) in the 02 Arena and Khan says he has to wait to face him . Does his May 29 fight with Algieri - recently floored six times by Pacquiao in Macao - help that crusade? ‘Algieri’s a better fighter than Frankie Gavin (Brook’s world title challenger next month). He’s world lightweight champion and he’s fought at a far higher level than Frankie. Kell can wait.’ Khan says: ‘Being at ringside (on May 2) will be a bit frustrating but I accept that this is the fight the whole world has been waiting to see. So no. I won’t be feeling any resentment.’ It is not much more than a half-hour’s flight from Oakland to Vegas. Amir Khan is hoping that the next time he takes to the air it will be on a magic carpet — to Arabia."

Police confirmed that Hannah Wilson's body was found on Friday in the rural area of Needmore, Indiana, which is about an hour drive outside Bloomington, where she attended school, police said. Daniel Messel, 49, of Bloomington, was arrested after a police investigation and he is facing a preliminary charge of murder. Brown County Coroner Earl Piper told the Herald Times that Wilson was struck three or four times in the back of the head with an unknown object, which was not found at the scene. Scroll down for video . Indiana University student Hannah Wilson, 22, was last seen at about 1am on Friday. Her body later turned up in a rural area of Brown County in Needmore, which is more than 20 miles from the Bloomington campus . A photo circulated social media on Friday in hopes of finding the Gamma Phi Beta sorority sister who was studying psychology . Piper said Wilson was found fully clothed and there was no sign of sexual assault, according to Sky News. Piper said that Wilson  would have been dead four to seven hours when police were notified that she was missing on Friday,  the Indy Star reported. With that being the timeline, Wilson, a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority at IU, would have died sometime between 1.30am and 4.30am. The connection between Messel and Wilson is unclear, police said. The young woman was last seen at around 1am on Friday, according to the Crimson Quarry. Toxicology reports for the woman will not be available for ten to 14 days. Information surrounding Wilson's disappearance has not been released, but she went missing on the same weekend of celebrations for the Little 500, an annual bicycle race held on campus that is known for its party atmosphere. Though rumors circulated on Twitter that Wilson was last seen getting into an Uber car - creating a possible connection to Messel being a driver - an Uber spokesperson told a Herald Times reporter that he was not a driver with the company. Daniel Messel, 49, of Bloomington, was arrested in connection to the case and faces a preliminary murder charge . Wilson, originally from Fishers, Indiana, was a senior studying psychology at the university. 'I can't even stop crying,' a friend of Wilson told WTHR. 'I keep expecting her to text me back or to wake up and this all be a horrible nightmare.' A friend of Wilson's, Matt Molewyk, posted a tribute to his 'best friend' on his Facebook fan page along with the pair of them together standing behind DJ equipment. He wrote: 'She was always there when I needed to talk and complain about trivial things. She could always get me to laugh when I was down. 'She's the rare type of person that really makes an impact on you. She was so loving and down to earth. She cared about everyone and she was a genuine person, which is rare these days.' He added that he planned to dedicate his DJ set on Friday to Wilson and that she was 'one of, if not the most loyal friend' he had. Matt Molewyk, pictured here with Wilson, wrote a tribute to his friend on Facebook, claiming that Wilson was 'one of, if not the most loyal friend' he had . Molewyk said that Wilson had an 'infectious' laugh and that he wished she was on stage with him like she had been in the past. He added: 'She was a wonderful human being and I hope that when the day comes that I leave this earth, that I can hopefully leave half as much of a positive impression on people as she did. 'I truly love you Hannah, and I would give anything and everything I have just to hangout with you one more day. I would even trade places with you because I am not half the person you are. 'I love you so much, and I will never forget you. I know you supported me and I am going to continue to pursue my dreams in hopes that I can make you proud and hopefully leave a positive impact on people, like you have left on me. 'I am so lucky to have had all the time that I did with you - thank you for being my friend and putting up with me. I love you so much Hoon.' Wilson went missing on the same night as the Little 500, an annual celebration surrounding a bicycle race on campus that is known for its party atmosphere. Police have not revealed information as to the connection between Wilson (pictured) and Messel . Other friends, too, posted photos together with Wilson and mourned the loss of the woman on social media. Indiana University released a statement on the incident Friday. Wilson's death comes four years after Indiana University student Lauren Spierer went missing in 2011. She was never found . 'The entire IU Bloomington community mourns the tragic death of Hannah Wilson. Our deepest sympathies go out to Hannah's family and friends during this unspeakably sad time,' the statement read. Gamma Phi Beta sorority also released a statement regarding Wilson's death. 'The entire Gamma Phi Beta family mourns the tragic loss of Hannah. She was a sister, friend and cherished member who will be genuinely missed,' International president Krista Davis said. She continued: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Hannah's friends, family and the women of Beta Phi Chapter'. This is not Messel's first run in with the police, according the the Indiana Daily Student. He was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and endangering persons in 1995. A year later he was sentenced to eight years in prison for battery by means of a deadly weapon and battery resulting in serious bodily injury. Indiana State Police have yet to release more information about the case. This isn't the first time, however, a woman has gone missing from IU's campus. Lauren Spierer was 20 years old when she went missing in 2011. Jill Behrman disappeared after going for a bike ride in 2011. Both cases still remain unsolved. Both Indiana University and the national organization of Gamma Phi Beta released statements regarding Wilson's (right) death. Gamma Phi's international president said Wilson was a 'sister, friend and cherished member who will genuinely be missed'"

But in a twist that she could never have foreseen, the other woman turned out to be her younger sister Larissa Knipe. Now, three years after the affair that tore her family apart, Ms Bourne says she is still struggling to come to terms with what happens - and still has bad days when she can't stop crying. Scroll down for video . Family feud: Larissa Knipe (left) is pictured with her son Logun and sister Leanne Bourne (right) 'I was very protective of Larissa because she was my baby sister,' she says of her happy upbringing. 'She wasn't just my sister. She was like a best friend and I'd do anything for her.' But all that changed when Larissa, who is seven years younger than Ms Bourne, moved into her home when she was 17. Although Larissa says there was nothing between her and Steve to begin with, a night out when she was 20 resulted in a liaison with her sister's partner - and the start of an affair. 'I was 20 when it first started with Steve,' she confesses. 'I went out one night, had a few too many drinks, came back, saw him and we started kissing. It started like that. 'The next morning, I woke up and thought, ""What have you done?"" I don't know why I carried it on to be honest but I did. After the first few months, I did start getting feelings and began falling for him.' Upset: Leanne Bourne appeared on ITV's This Morning to tell her story . Rapprochement: Larissa is finally winning back her sister after more than three years in the cold . Caught in the middle: Sarah Guyton was caught in the centre of the increasingly acrimonious dispute . Noticing that the pair were spending increasing amounts of time together, Ms Bourne became suspicious but, believing that her sister would do nothing to hurt her, stayed quiet. 'I mentioned it to a couple of friends, to a couple of work colleagues,' she remembers. 'One or two of my friends actually said, ""What you're thinking, it's probably feasible"". 'Everybody else, including my mum, said, ""What are you thinking? That's your sister. She loves you. She would never do that to you"".' Then, a few months later, Larissa revealed she was pregnant and claimed not to know who the father was. 'Larissa had never really had a boyfriend. If she had, I'd never met any. Then one day I came home from work and she said she was pregnant,' Ms Bourne recalls. But she was left even more suspicious by her sister and Mr Allsop's reaction. 'Larissa and Steve were both over the moon about it, really happy,' she says. 'I was quite concerned. I really felt like I was going crazy, like I was losing it. I was having a battle in my own mind.' Putting her fears to one side, she supported her sister and was there when Larissa gave birth to her son Logun in August 2011. Speaking on ITV's This Morning, Ms Bourne says she was convinced that her sister was the other woman the moment she saw the newborn. Shock: Leanne also spoke of the moment that she realised her sister's baby had been fathered by her partner . 'I had suspicions anyway but as soon as I saw the baby, I knew because not only did it look like Steve, it look like my children when they were babies. It was just too much for coincidence. 'I had to run out of the room. I saw a friend straight after and I said, ""That baby is Steve's"". Larissa, who moved out into a council flat of her own shortly afterwards, continued to deny all talk of an affair. But then, consumed with guilt, she finally confessed the truth to their mother Sarah Guyton in a text message that read: 'Well what's she going to do when she finds out Logun is Steve's? I can't hide it any more.' 'I answered the phone and my mum's in a panic,' remembers Ms Bourne. 'She was actually crying, so I said, ""Calm down mum, what's happened?"" 'And she said, ""I'm sorry to tell you but what you've been worrying about is true"".' Ms Bourne was, she says, left 'utterly devastated' by the news and furious that despite repeated questioning, both Larissa and Steve had point-blank denied having an affair. Then, a few days after the bombshell hit, Steve moved out of Ms Bourne's home and in with her sister. 'It was a nightmare,' remembers Ms Bourne. 'I did send her some nasty text messages. I called her every name under the sun. I think most people in my position would have.' Larissa responded angrily and more than three years on, the sisters are still estranged and struggling to come to terms with what happened. 'It's still heartbreaking really,' adds Ms Bourne. 'To think we were really close and that's all gone. It's vanished. It's non existent now.'"

The adored school teacher from Leeton went missing on Easter Sunday and her body was found in nearby bushland the following Friday. Ms Scott's grieving father Robert explained that it is especially painful that Stephanie's life has been taken away when she had so much to look forward to. She was also a person who gave so much joy to others. 'Stephanie's aim was to get everyone feeling like it was their wedding as much as hers,' Mr Scott told The Daily Telegraph, describing Ms Scott's bubbly and thoughtful personality. Scroll down for video . Ms Scott's grieving father Robert explained that it is especially painful that Stephanie's life has been taken away when she had so much to look forward to . Police were lead to the place where Stephanie Scott's remains were found, by the family of her accused killer . A guest list of 120 people had been invited to Stephanie and her fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley's wedding at the picturesque Eat Your Greens venue . The venue in Eugowra, pictured the day their wedding was scheduled to take place. It was decorated by loved ones with yellow balloons and flowers to pay tribute to murder victim Stephanie Scott . There are reminders of the wedding all over the house, yet instead of a wedding the Scott family must tragically prepare for Stephanie's funeral. 'You walk around the house and there's so many little things she planned for the wedding,' said Mr Scott. 'That's the most devastating thing — they're not going to be used.' Ms Scott was incredibly excited for her wedding day to her childhood sweetheart, Aaron Leeson-Woolley and had put a great deal of time and thought into making the big perfect. 'You walk around the house and there's so many little things she planned for the wedding,' said Mr Scott (left, pictured with Stephanie's mother and one of her sisters) The happy couple, Aaron Leeson-Woolley and Stephanie Scott (both pictured right), had sent out invites for their wedding day which was supposed to be held on Saturday . The high school where she worked turned into a memorial site after it emerged Ms Scott had been murdered . The ceremony was due to go ahead on Saturday April 11 - however cruelly the day before her remains were discovered by police. Ms Scott and Mr Leeson-Woolley had been taking dancing lessons together to prepare for their first dance as an excited married couple, according to Robert. But the moment when Mr Leeson-Woolley should have been holding his new bride during their planned first dance to a Keith Urban song, he was inconsolable at his fiancée's memorial. Ms Scott's father says he has been contemplating the afterlife since Ms Scott's shocking death, but is confident that his beautiful, sweet daughter is in 'the best possible place' after living a life full of love and happiness. 'When you die I don't know what happens really, but you leave this body and our spirit is what goes on,' Mr Scott told The Daily Telegraph. 'She had plenty of spirit so, whatever happens, she should be in the best place possible because she had one of the best spirits you've ever come across.' Ms Scott's father (second from left) says he has contemplated the afterlife since Ms Scott's shocking death, but is confident that his sweet daughter is in 'the best possible place' after living a life full of love and happiness . 'When you die I don't know what happens really, but you leave this body and our spirit is what goes on,' Mr Scott (far left) said . Mr Scott paid tribute to his daughter, remember her joyful childhood from her birth in Sydney, early childhood in Sydney's St Clair and time on the land from the age of nine, living in Canowindra. She loved her family, drama, soccer and school - eager for every opportunity to learn. It comes after local Leeton parents expressed anger over the loss of their children's 'favourite teacher' as the town continues to mourn the death of Stephanie Scott. Stephanie Scott was a 'favourite teacher' to many students at Leeton High School . A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their kids. 'Well said, my daughter has lost her favourite teacher, and she will never be the same,' wrote Glenda Goolagong. Meanwhile Jodie Salerno posted: 'Stephanie was my son and 2 daughters favourite teacher at leeton high this ... has put so much pain and sadness on our comunity [sic].' Ms Salerno told The Australian her three children 'don't want to return' to school because they are so upset over Ms Scott's death. This comes as police are due to begin an autopsy on Stephanie Scott's body to determine how she was killed. Ms Scott's remains have been transported to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, and a NSW Department of Justice spokeswoman confirmed State Coroner Michael Barnes has ordered that an autopsy be carried out this week. Detectives who are leading the investigation into the death of Stephanie Scott will reportedly make inquiries with authorities in the Netherlands in an attempt to run a background check on the accused killer. School cleaner Vincent Stanford, who moved to Leeton  from Holland over a year ago with his mother and brother, was charged with Ms Scott's murder on Thursday. A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their children . Her body was discovered on Friday evening around 5pm in Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW . NSW Police will get in contact with their counterparts in the Netherlands to determine if the accused 24-year-old murderer had any relevant history there, AAP reports. Stanford has reportedly been uncooperative with investigators. Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW police for comment. It has also emerged that one of the last actions of Ms Scott was to send an email to the bus company hired for her wedding, confirming transportation for guests. The revelation follows after police discovered the charred remains of a woman's body around 5pm on Friday after they were directed to Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW by  Stanford's family. It's further alleged a gasoline can had been found nearby. It is understood Stanford was familiar to the area and went on regular camping trips to the national park  on many occasions with his family. On Saturday - the day which English and drama teacher Ms Scott was set to marry her fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley - a memorial was held to honour the late bride-to-be. Ms Scott, pictured on a wine tour for her hen party last month in Canberra last month with her mother Merrilyn . On Saturday, the day Ms Scott was due to marry fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley, a memorial was held . Aaron Leeson-Woolley was comforted by friends and family at the heartbreaking service at the weekend . In a poignant move, the memorial service took place at the same time as when her wedding ceremony was due to take place. Her father Robert Scott spoke to the gathered mourners on behalf of his family and friends who were united in their grief on Saturday at Mountford Park in Leeton. The 26-year-old was last seen on Easter Sunday, when her disappearance sparked a widespread search for the much-loved teacher. 'Stephanie was a bright, intelligent and fun-loving woman who has impacted on many people here today,' Mr Scott said at his daughter's memorial on Saturday. 'Our wishes for the future are that this stays in your minds and you remember her. 'I'm sure she'd wish for that to be the case and you could remember her for the great little girl she was.' Ms Scott's grief-stricken fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley was too upset to take the stage, but was supported by loved ones to release yellow balloons into the air to commemorate her life. A vigil has been created at the school where the popular 26-year-old teacher taught drama and English ."
be02d9741cadb3a42e4440ab885f8d9094d6deee,"A man who shot himself in the head while waiting in a Las Vegas hotel buffet line sent a 270 page letter to a local newspaper explaining his shocking public suicide. In the angry and emotional package delivered to the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Monday, John Noble, 53, said he was going to kill himself because he lost his lifetime free pass to the M Resort's buffet for harassing female employees in 2013. Included in the detailed package was a two hour DVD in which a clearly upset Noble addresses the camera and a letter entitled 'The Curse', wishing harm on the women he blames for having him banned from the casino. Scroll Down for Video . Explanation: John Noble sent a 270 page package to the Las Vegas Review-Journal complete with two hour DVD to explain why he shot himself on Easter Sunday at the M Resort . Grevience: John Noble (pictured here with an employee of M Resort) was reportedly upset because he had lost free buffet eating privileges he'd won from the casino in a suburb of Las Vegas . Revoked: This the Biggest Winner free buffet ticket that was taken away from Noble after he allegedly harassed female members of staff at the M Resort after the death of his mother . 'Today, I end my life due to the M Resort Spa Casino and its employees,' said Noble, who included a huge dossier on the members of staff at the resort he blamed for having his free food pass revoked. On Sunday afternoon at around 4.50pm,. Noble shot himself in the head in front of stunned hotel guests at the resorts famed Studio B Buffet after setting his car on fire in the parking lot. Inside the package that Noble sent to the Review-Journal are reams of notes and documents including a table of contents, photographs and his video bemoaning the loss of his free buffet access which he won in September 2010. 'In this video, you will learn the reasons why I, John Noble, one-time Biggest Winner, was suicidal on Easter Sunday.' During his video, Noble demonstrates encounters he has had with the M Resort staff who all try to patiently explain to him why he cannot be granted access anymore. Explanation: An agitated Noble included videos of his futile interactions with employees at the M Resort as they tell him he can't eat at the buffet . Ominous: At the end of his DVD recording, Noble flashes text that reads 'The End' and heralds his own suicide . Fury: This is the Facebook posting from Easter Sunday in which Noble attacks staff members at M Resort for taking away his free buffet for life pass . 'You gotta fight for what you believe in and I believe that I was unjustly kicked out, cause if they do have a policy that team members aren't allowed to fraternize with customers and guests then they broke the policy.' Becoming increasingly agitated, Noble begins to lash out at people for not helping. 'That's the trouble, people do not get involved,' says Noble. 'That's why this world is so screwed up.' On Easter Sunday, just hours before he took his own life, Noble uploaded a furious invective to Facebook attacking the women he believes got him banned from the casino and the buffet. He writes, 'If you noticed on my friends list are a few lawyers & judges I been trying the past few years to find an attorney to represent me against the lies and slander the M Resort has falsely made about me, even though a few attorneys I met say it’s a good case trying to find one on contingency or pro bono has been a difficult task.' Angry, Noble writes that everyone at the M Resort are 'hateful' and pathetic' and says, 'It is sad that this is what our society has become. I’ve been destroyed because I told the truth, I never thought any type of backlash would be so brutal to destroy me in this way. I’m a genuine person proved by my inability to properly deal with everything that happened.' He then goes onto give address and names of the women he says got him barred, which the Daily Mail Online is not publishing. In the disturbing and detailed package sent to the Review-Journal, Noble mentions a prior suicide attempt from Easter Sunday 2013 just after he lost his pass, which also happened to be three weeks after the death of his beloved mother, Norma. According to a Henderson police report included by Noble, he was accused by an employee of the casino for stalking, which is believed to be the reason they revoked his pass and banned him from the premesis. Indeed, after the police arrested him for stalking he spent three days in a state psychiatric hospital after presumably suffering a breakdown. Devastated: John Noble's mental state appeared to deteriorate after the death of his mother, Norma (pictured) which appeared to set in motion the chain of events that led to him losing his buffet pass . John Noble said the M Casino Resort and Spa gave him a free lifetime gift of daily buffet meals in September 2010 but revoked it in 2013 over alleged harassment of female restaurant employees, according to newspaper accounts . After he recovered sufficiently, Noble began to contact local media in the hope they would tell his story and even met a reporter from the Review Journal in a Las Vegas Starbucks. The reporter has said that Noble was paranoid and nervous talking about the hotel and repeatedly attacked its employees and management during their conversation. Noble's death set off panic at the casino, as people dined at the packed Easter buffet around 5pm on Sunday. The Las Vegas man apparently described his plans for the suicide in a letter to the Las Vegas Review Journal , which was received by the newspaper Monday. Michael Hengel, the editor of the newspaper, confirmed the package was from John Noble. Police spokeswoman Michelle French said the Review-Journal contacted Henderson police reporting the package and that investigators will meet with the newspaper to review it. Police said a 53-year-old man was found dead with an apparent self-inflicted wound and that a car fire in the parking garage is linked to the shooting. The death set off panic at the casino, as people dined at the packed Easter buffet around 5 p.m. Sunday . The incident happened at the M Resort Spa and Casino in Henderson, Nevada on Easter Sunday . On Sunday, Noble wrote in a Facebook post 'I been trying the past few years to find an attorney to represent me against the lies and slander the M Resort has falsely made about me.' The message also included the addresses and names of several women who apparently were casino employees. Both employees and the casino were targets of Noble on social media for some time, the Review-Journal reported. Marina Rizk, a 21-year-old college student from Los Angeles, said in a telephone interview she was with three people on Sunday evening and had waited an hour to get into the buffet. They had just finished eating and were outside of the restaurant when people shouted about a man with a gun in the line. 'There were people in Easter dresses,' she said. Rizk described a chaotic scene. As she ran out of the casino, she said she warned others before going to hide in the bushes outside. 'I remember this one little boy. I remember telling the family, ""Get the baby. Run. There's a guy with a gun,""' she said. 13-year-old Sierra Abanilla told the Review-Journal while on a buffet line '[Me and my family] heard this loud boom, and it sounded like a balloon that popped but it was too loud to be that. 'I was in shock...I couldn't think, hear, or feel. It was like my senses just stopped working.' No one else was shot but two people suffered minor injuries. One person was taken to the hospital after a fall and another was checked out at the scene. A spokeswoman for the casino did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment from Daily Mail Online. To speak to a counselor, contact the National Suicide Prevention Line at 1-800-273-8255 ."
36b41631c9c227d91cb348154e98f942b82334a6,"It was the sort of training ground accident that can happen to anyone, but it had far-reaching consequences for Philipp Lahm. So too, indirectly, for Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt. Lahm's tackle on a team-mate at Bayern Munich's training ground on the outskirts of the city appeared innocuous enough, until a scream of pain pierced the morning air and a frantic wave signalled he was in trouble. As players milled round him, and a physio inspected the damage, the call went out for expert medical help. There wasn't any. To the dismay of Pep Guardiola, there wasn't a single qualified doctor on site. Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt quit this week after a reported rift with Pep Guardiola . The pair fell out over an injury to Philipp Lahm during training as early as November last year . As Lahm lay on the turf with what was later diagnosed as a broken ankle, the physio tended to him as best he could, while an ambulance was summoned to take him to a local hospital. Muller-Wohlfahrt, meanwhile, was at his city centre clinic, nearly eight miles away. It was last November, and from that day on, the 72-year-old's days as head of Bayern's medical department were numbered. They finally ended after Bayern's Champions' League defeat at Porto, when Guardiola went public with his displeasure over recovery rates for injured players by blaming a lengthening injury list for his side's quarter-final first-leg demise. It was more than the world-renowned specialist could stomach, and he promptly walked away from the Bundesliga champions for a second time, taking the rest of his staff with him. He quit in high dudgeon once before, after a fall-out with Jurgen Klinsmann, but there will be no coming back this time. Not as long as Guardiola holds the reins. And that may just be for quite a while yet. The Bayern boss is aware Manchester City long to install him as replacement for Manuel Pellegrini, even if it means waiting another 12 months for his contract to expire, but the latest ructions at The Allianz Arena have evidently done nothing to increase their chances. Bayern  doctor Muller-Wohlfahrt is a world-renowned specialist and quit after Guardiola's injury complaints . The 72-year-old had been at Bayern for almost 40 years but is now unlikely to return to the Bundesliga club . Unseemly though his undermining of Muller-Wohlfahrt may have been, there was only ever going to be one winner. And, by all accounts, when his hand was raised in triumph, it strengthened his hold on power like never before. Dispiritingly for City, the former Barcelona manager reaffirmed, at his Friday press conference, that he will 'for sure' honour the remaining year on his contract, ruling out any hope of a deal being struck with Etihad bosses this summer. Beyond that, he could even commit himself to a further spell in charge, according to a Bayern insider, who told Sportsmail: 'There is no question that Bayern will do absolutely everything in their power to persuade Guardiola to sign another contract. 'There will be negotiations after the season is finished, and there is an air of confidence within the club that he will agree. It is far from certain, but, interestingly, the departure of Muller-Wohlfahrt makes it more probable, rather than less so. Muller-Wohlfahrt (fourth from left) sits behind Pep Guardiola during the defeat by Porto this week . Manchester City long to bring in Guardiola to replace Manuel Pellegrini but they may have to wait for him . 'That was a problem, because they had many disagreements over the treatment of injured players. Now he has gone, Guardiola is in a stronger position than ever. That is clear, because when Muller- Wohlfahrt said he was leaving, the club made no attempt to talk him out of it. They simply accepted it and said thanks very much. 'Pep has got his own way again, and that could play a part when they sit down in the summer to discuss a new deal.' So what went wrong between them? How could it be that a vastly- experienced and hugely-respected surgeon with a track record for rescuing stellar careers imperilled by injury failed to meet Guardiola's requirements as club doctor? Certainly, availability was a major issue. Sportsmail has learned that one of Guardiola's stipulations, after taking over from Jupp Heynckes, was that the club doctor should be at the training ground every single time the players were there. Dante, Sebastian Rode, Lahm and Robert Lewandowski (L-R) trudge off the pitch after defeat in Porto . Muller-Wohlfahrt has worked with the German national team as well as athletes including Usain Bolt . Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt has often courted controversy with his methods. He claims that a substance called Hyalart, which is extracted from the crest of cockerels, helps lubricate knee injuries and take away pain. He also swears by Actovegin, an amino acid preparation derived from calves' blood. In 2009, he prescribed more than 50 injections of goat's blood to St Johnstone striker Peter MacDonald for his hamstring injury. Among those to have been treated by him are Ronaldo, Usain Bolt, Michael Owen and Jose Maria Olazabal. Muller-Wohlfahrt claims to have administered more than one million injections, at least half of which have been to athletes. A stickler for detail, he wanted to ensure any mishap could be dealt with expertly at a moment's notice and made it clear it was an instruction to be adhered to by Muller-Wohlfahrt. It placed club bosses in a quandary, not for the last time, as Muller-Wohlfahrt pointed out he had a steady stream of high-profile patients to his city centre practice, not least the likes of Usain Bolt, and that he could ill-afford to desert his post to spend day after day at the club's training facility. Irked by Muller-Wohlfahrt's defiance, it soon became apparent to Guardiola that they were diametrically opposed when it came to policy over ushering players back from injury. In a nutshell, Guardiola wanted players declared fit and pencilled in for selection as rapidly as possible, whereas care and caution were the key words for Muller-Wohlfahrt. It drove Guardiola to distraction, according to the club insider, who said: 'Pep has never been the most patient about players' recovery time. If there is an injury, he expects it to clear up. He wants the players back on the pitch, but it wasn't happening. 'Muller-Wohlfahrt is the opposite. He takes the view that you have to be patient and allow the healing process to take its course. He wants a player to be in perfect condition when he returns and argues that rushing people back runs the risk of a fresh injury. Really, it's no wonder they were at loggerheads.' Guardiola wanted players declared fit as rapidly as possible, but Muller-Wohlfahrt wanted care and caution . Muller-Wohlfahrt prescribed a course of action for a nagging injury to Thiago Alcantara but was overruled. As a further insight into the core differences between the pair, Muller-Wohlfahrt prescribed a specific course of action for a nagging injury to Thiago Alcantara but was overruled. The midfielder suffered damage to the same area of his knee three times in quick succession, and Muller-Wohlfahrt was adamant he should attend the veteran medic's clinic in Colorado for specialised treatment. Guardiola was having none of it and, instead, arranged for Thiago to undergo treatment in Barcelona, where, to Muller-Wohlfahrt's exasperation, surgery was followed by recuperation and an eventual return to the Bayern squad. Usain Bolt was one of many athletes to benefit from Muller-Wohlfahrt's treatment at the London Olympics . Guardiola is now in the strongest position he has ever been at Bayern and he could agree a new deal there . If protesting to the Bayern boss was futile, trying to appeal to Thiago was just as pointless. His agent is none other than Guardiola's brother, Pere. The odds were stacked ever-higher against Muller-Wohlfahrt, and his resignation on Friday morning was merely confirmation the Guardiola empire is not about to be overthrown. City must now wait to see if the Spaniard's Bavarian rule is about to be extended, as forecast with growing confidence in Munich circles."
e7f12c2f25d615e95605f660aac2cf035ab55e95,"The brother of Australia's most notorious serial killer has confessed to knowing of his evil sibling's first victim - and to hiding the truth for 50 years as the 'wrong man' was convicted and behind bars. Boris Milat detailed how his brother, Ivan, shot and paralysed a taxi driver in 1962, more then 25 years before he went on a backpacker killing spree, according to Channel 7's Sunday Night. Neville Knight was shot on March 6, 1962, by a 17-year-old Milat who was riding in the back of his taxi. Scroll down for video . A new report claims Ivan Milat, Australia's most notorious serial killer, could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers . Mr Milat confessed the shooting was his murderous brother's first violent crime, despite police never once considering him a suspect. 'Ivan shot him - he told me the next day,' Mr Milat told the program. 'His intentions were to rob the driver of his takings. The gun had a hair-trigger... the gun went off. 'The bloke straight away knew he had lost everything in his bottom end. 'You know, his legs ... feelings. He knew it went through his back. He knew he was ... Ivan had paralysed him. 'He (Ivan) got out of the cab and ran.' Alan Dillon was convicted for the shooting and spent five years behind bars. Dillon even confessed to the crime, in an attempt to protect his own brother. Boris Milat told the program a secret about his brother he had kept for more than 52 years . Milat was later sentenced to life in prison, but if the 'wrong man' (right) had not been jailed for his first crime, Milat's victims could have been saved, the program claims . 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man imprisoned for Milat's first violent crime, Alan Dillon (right), told the killer's brother, Boris (left) 'They were asking me questions and getting me to sign things,' Dillon told the program when explaining why he confessed to a crime he didn't commit. He said he believed police were going to charge his younger brother for the crime, and confessed to protect him. In the years since, he had always believed the reason for his confession was true, until the program contacted him with its theory. According to claims made by the program, Milat was 17 years old when he shot his first victim, Neville Knight . The daughter of Milat's first victim, Deborah Hutton, was told her father was shot by the serial killer . The report claims Milat's seven victims could have been saved if he had been been held accountable for this first chilling crime . Mr Milat said he also lied to protect a brother, but was confessing to bring closure to Dillon. 'Ivan said they were blaming someone else,' he told Sunday Night. 'I didn't think it was good but I didn't want to see him go to jail either, you know, I didn't want to see him harmed. 'But I want to bring closure to the other man, that's why I'm talking. 'Ivan shot this bloke in the back.' Forensic psychiatrist Dr Julian Parmegiani told Sunday Night it was possible Milat set out to paralyse Mr Knight. The horrific intent was shown in his later crimes, where he paralysed many of his victims before they were murdered. Superintendent Clive Small led the investigation into the backpacker murders and now also believes Milat is responsible for the shooting of Knight more than 50 years ago. 'A number of the victims, most of the victims, had multiple stab wounds to the back, around the spinal area, which suggested he was trying to paralyse them while keeping them alive,' Small said. British backpacker Caroline Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head when police found her body . The program also puts Mr Milat face-to-face with the 'wrong man', who was jailed for the first crime his brother committed. 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' Dillon told Mr Milat, as the pair shook hands. Mr Milat told Dillon: 'you've been on me mind a lot'. Mr Knight's daughter, Deborah Hutton, was also unaware her 'courageous' father was Milat's first victim. First victims: Australians James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both aged 19, were Ivan Milat's first known victims after they disappeared in December 1989 and their bodies were found in the Belanglo State forest almost four years later . Simone Schmidl's body was found in November 1993. She had been stabbed to death . Ms Hutton said it was confronting to be told Milat may have shot her father. 'If Dad was the first attempted 'thrill kill'... how horrified can anyone be?' she said. Mr Knight went on to become an advocate for the rights of people with disabilities before he died in 1998. Mr Milat said he hopes his confession can help ease the pain of people impacted by his brother's crimes, and he thought about the first incident 'all the time'. Boyfriend and girlfriend German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied were found dead on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart . British backpacker Joanne Walters, is another one of the victims of backpacker murderer Ivan Milat . 'I thought about it... 'how the hell do I fix that'?' he told the program. 'It was a monkey on my back - I had to get rid of it. 'It's not about the victims... it's about the families. The main object of the thing is bringing closure to the other man.' According to the timeline presented by the program and Mr Milat, his murderous brother would have been a 17-year-old when he claimed his first victim. Sinister souvenir: In this photograph police seized from the house of Ivan Milat's brother William, the serial killer is seen carrying the sleeping bag which belonged to Deborah Everist who with boyfriend Jame Gibson was the first of Milat's victims killed in the Belanglo State Forest . Milat, 70, was convicted of butchering seven young people between 1989 and 1992 and burying their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW. He has been locked up in Goulburn's Supermax jail for almost 20 years. The first two bodies of Milat's victims were discovered on September 19 and 20 1992, when two runners found a decaying corpse in the Belanglo State Forest. Police later confirmed the bodies were of missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters. Walters had been stabbed 35 times and Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head. Australia's worst serial killer Ivan Milat kept trophies to remind him of each murder . Milat butchered and buried the bodies of seven young people between 1989 and 1992 in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW . The grim finds were just the beginning of a long and extensive search which resulted in the bodies of Australians Deborah Everist and James Gibson being found in October 1993, followed by Simone Schmidl's stabbed body in November of the same year. The decapitated body of German backpacker Anja Habschied was then found along with her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart. Milat was convicted of the seven backpacker murders on July 27, 1996 and for the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Paul Onions. He kept the shirts, sleeping bags, a water bottle, portable stove and backpacks of his victims hidden in roof and wall cavities, in what was described as an 'Aladdin's Cave', in the house he was arrested in 20 years ago."

Mr Figueroa's date, Teresa Galarce, 22, suffered a broken nose, a broken rib and a punctured lung. She is now recovering from her injuries. It is unknown whether she attended Tuesday's funeral. The explosion also caused fires at 119, 123 and 125 Second Avenue. All buildings apart from 125 ultimately crumbled to the ground, prompting an enormous response from emergency crews. Following the recovery of his body, Mr Figueroa's family had started raising money to help cover his funeral costs and other expenses via a GoFundMe page, which amassed more than $27,000. On Monday, it was reported that a plumber who worked on the building has accused the building's landlord's son of making him illegally tap a gas line ahead of the deadly blast on March 26. The unidentified plumber admitted that he illegally tapped a gas line before the explosion but said he only did so on the orders of the landlord's son, Michael Hrynenko Jr., the New York Post reported. Another victim: Last week, Mr Figueroa's body was tragically pulled from the building's rubble alongside that of 26-year-old busboy, Moises Locon (pictured), who had worked at the sushi restaurant six days a week . Aftermath: Firefighters continue to hose down the site of the fire that gutted three buildings on March 27 . The gas was apparently being siphoned from the restaurant to tenants in the building. Investigators suspect the illegal hookup was switched before Con Ed inspectors visited the building on March 26, and after they left, it was put back, the Post reported. It added that authorities have not yet decided whether to use the plumber's statement against him or if they will get him to testify in exchange for a deal. Neither the landlord, Maria Hrynenko, nor her 29-year-old son Michael, who also goes by the name 'Mischou', responded to the paper's requests for comment. On Monday, it was claimed that a plumber who worked on the building has accused the landlord's son, Michael Hrynenko Jr (pictured), of making him illegally tap a gas line ahead of the deadly blast . Property records show he lives in Sparkhill in Rockland County, New York after moving from 7th Street in the East Village last year, where he lived in an apartment owned by his family. The investigation continues as authorities continue to pick through the rubble at the site. But charges including second-degree manslaughter and reckless endangerment could be brought against anyone believed to have been behind the blast, the Post reported. In August, utility workers found that the gas line had been illegally tapped, Con Ed said. The discovery led the company to shut down gas service to the building for about 10 days while the building owner made repairs. Gas service was restored after the utility deemed it safe. Inspectors from Con Ed visited that building about an hour before the explosion and determined work to upgrade gas service didn't pass inspection, locking the line to ensure it wouldn't be used. The work underway was to put in a bigger line to serve the entire building, according to Con Ed. But 15 minutes after the workers left, the smell of gas was reported. No one called 911 or Con Ed. Instead, Michael Hrynenko and a contractor, Dilber Kukic, opened the basement door to check on where the smell was coming from. When they did so, a massive explosion shot through the building, forcing rubble onto the street and sparking a fire that spread to neighboring buildings. Both Michael Hrynenko and the contractor escaped the scene, but officials later pulled the bodies of Mr Figueroa and Mr Locon, who worked at the restaurant six days a week, from the rubble. The contractor, Dilber Kukic - who is facing unrelated charges of bribing an undercover investigator posing as a housing inspector - declined through his lawyer to comment on the explosion."
